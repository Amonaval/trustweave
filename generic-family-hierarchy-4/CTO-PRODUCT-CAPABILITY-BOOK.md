# TrustWeave — CTO Product Capability Book

**As of:** 2026-09-12  
**Purpose:** engineering/product leadership summary of what the platform can do, what is shared, what is vertical-specific, and what is still gated.

## 1. Product identity

1. TrustWeave is a multi-vertical **Network OS** for private, governed real-world networks.
2. The platform evolved from a Family network application into reusable network infrastructure.
3. A user can participate in multiple independent networks.
4. Each network remains permissioned and context-specific.
5. The system deliberately avoids a universal public social graph.
6. Cross-network interoperability is explicit, governed and consent-aware.
7. The product supports both consumer/community and institutional network types.
8. Current showcase emphasis is Family, Family Community / Cultural Association and Residential / Housing Society.
9. Additional supported verticals remain in the codebase even when hidden from public Create/Playground through Launch Control.
10. Existing memberships are never supposed to disappear because a vertical is hidden from new creation.

## 2. Shared platform architecture

11. Next.js application shell with shared cross-vertical runtime composition.
12. Supabase/Postgres persistence, Auth and private Storage foundations.
13. Typed vertical registry and capability composition.
14. Shared network model with network identifiers and memberships.
15. Shared active-network context.
16. Shared user identity anchor with network-local profiles/entities preserved.
17. Reusable feature/capability registry rather than copying full products per vertical.
18. Vertical-specific vocabulary and semantics remain explicit.
19. Core architecture follows **shared primitives + domain modules + vertical composition**.
20. Compatibility facades preserve older Family flows while shared contracts evolve.
21. Application-owned API/runtime boundaries exist for selected production operations.
22. Health/readiness/runtime hardening foundations exist from Mission 4/5.
23. Duplicate/expensive command protection and bounded abuse controls were introduced in the production-runtime track.
24. Existing architecture favors additive migrations and backward compatibility.
25. Network deletion/lifecycle safety is treated as a governed operation, not a blind table delete.

## 3. Identity, membership and access

26. Authenticated accounts can belong to multiple networks.
27. Network membership has status and role semantics.
28. Owner/Admin/Member style roles are supported.
29. Active-network switching is first-class.
30. My Networks provides a cross-vertical membership home.
31. Invitations support network-scoped joining.
32. Claiming flows map a signed-in person to the appropriate network-local profile/entity.
33. Family and generic network creation are supported.
34. Creation approval can be auto-approved or manually governed at platform level.
35. Platform owners can inspect a network registry and approval status.
36. Creation finalization verifies profile, membership and active-network consistency.
37. Approved network creation should navigate directly into the newly created network.
38. Pending approval preserves the user’s previous active-network context.
39. Membership visibility is not tied to public showcase availability.
40. Role administration is network-scoped.

## 4. Privacy and authorization

41. Network isolation is a core invariant.
42. Read/write checks are network-scoped.
43. Private media uses signed access rather than permanent public URLs.
44. Public/anonymous experiences intentionally expose reduced, privacy-masked data.
45. Notifications re-check membership when read/opened.
46. Deep links do not confer access.
47. Complaint media has stricter authorization than ordinary community/event media.
48. Cross-network/federation features do not imply child-graph disclosure.
49. Trusted bridges are explicit and revocable.
50. Multi-hop discovery requires policy on every traversed bridge.
51. Introduction/consent flows were designed to prevent silent cross-network exposure.
52. Destructive actions are protected more heavily in Playground/showcase contexts.
53. Platform QA includes role/permission/destructive-safety phases.
54. Security remediation Phase 5A–5C exists as a separate track and has been intentionally paused/revisited selectively rather than conflated with showcase work.

## 18. Current boundary and next program

247. E1–E5 engagement foundations are the latest implemented sequence.
248. E6 is planned for Community membership funds, pooled funds and event collections.
249. E7 is planned for elections, nominations, polls and voting integrity/audit.
250. E8 is planned for media archive, quota visibility, selective deletion and cleanup management.
251. E6–E8 should reuse the E1–E5 notification/media foundations rather than introduce parallel systems.
252. Real-world MPF/community and Residential usage should drive the next product decisions.
253. No major new vertical should be prioritized ahead of engagement/pilot proof unless strategy changes explicitly.


## Engagement closure E6–E10
- E6 adds auditable network funds/collection primitives.
- E7 separates participation identity from secret vote choice and snapshots eligibility.
- E8 adds explicit media lifecycle state and storage-management controls.
- E9 reuses the shared activity model for community posts/broadcasts rather than introducing a second feed architecture.
- **E10 Engagement Control Center** stores per-user/per-network delivery preferences and evaluates them server-side before Web Push. Quiet-hours suppression and category muting do not mutate notification source records.
<!-- FINAL-LAUNCH-CLOSURE -->
## Final launch architecture closure

The launch-data system is deliberately an orchestration layer, not a new domain platform. Residential seeding composes the HS1–HS5/engagement remotes; Family Community seeding composes generic import, FCA governed membership/role APIs, shared funds/voting/activity/media/invitation capabilities. A narrow migration stores authorization and lineage only. Direct access to the lineage tables is revoked from normal client roles and all write/read operations are exposed through network-scoped security-definer RPCs requiring admin/platform-owner access.

Idempotency is source-row based: each dataset version, section and stable row reference stores a deterministic payload hash and remote record ID. Unchanged rows skip; mutable rows can update through product APIs; historical/immutable rows are not duplicated. The design intentionally does not create a destructive reset RPC or insert notification rows merely for visual density.

The remaining release gate is environmental/runtime, not an architectural waiver: install from the lockfile in a network-enabled environment, run lint/type/build, apply migrations through 114 to approved staging, and execute headed/mobile persisted-network certification.

## 2026-09-15 — Seeded-network rehearsal hotfix
The first real seeded Residential rehearsal exposed live contract/UX defects that source-only certification had not proven. Migration **114** now restores the missing `hs4_get_operations_snapshot()` and `route_network_mentions(...)` RPCs, fixes the invalid funds `a.type` reference, makes explicit **Open Voting** open immediately, and decouples Storage authorization from profile active-network drift while preserving network membership isolation.

Housing Society UX was also restructured after real laptop use showed unacceptable information density: Manage Society now renders one categorized workspace at a time; Finance, Governance and Security have focused subsections; Housing More is grouped; and Appearance is reduced to a single **Classic / Modern / Dark** selector. These are launch-hardening changes, not new product scope.

**Runtime status:** source gates are green, but this hotfix is not considered proven until migration 114 is applied to the real/staging database and the reported operations/funds/voting/mentions/media paths are retested.
