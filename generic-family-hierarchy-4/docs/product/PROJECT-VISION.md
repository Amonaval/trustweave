# G9 PRODUCT VISION UPDATE

The product is no longer merely a Generic Network OS. Its differentiating direction is a **Network Decision & Action Layer**: convert relationships, affiliations and captured outcomes into the right person, path, evidence and next action. The graph is infrastructure; repeated decision advantage is the product value.

# Project Vision --- Relationship Intelligence Platform

## Immediate North Star

Deliver a family product so attractive, fast and easy that a non-technical
relative can create or join a family, understand the tree and contribute without
training. Mobile is the primary surface. English must never be a prerequisite;
initial supported product languages are English, Hindi and Marathi.

For the current family releases, the product is judged by successful setup,
Excel import, joining, exploration, contribution, sharing and return visits—not
by enterprise feature count or generic architecture.

## Long-term North Star

Build a **vertical-strong family/community product on top of a genuinely
reusable relationship-network platform**.

Family is the proving ground: it demands hierarchy, identity, lineage,
privacy, invitations, memories, life events, geography, governance, and
non-technical usability. The platform underneath should be extensible
enough to support higher-value domains without weakening the family
experience.

## Commercial Objective

**Sustainable monetization is a primary product objective.** Product and
architecture decisions should preserve credible paths to paid usage. We
should not optimize only for feature count or technical elegance.

The intended model is: - **Shared platform core** --- graph,
entity/profile primitives, typed edges, search, privacy, permissions,
invitations, audit/change workflow, media, timeline primitives,
analytics, exports. - **Domain modules** --- loaded/enabled only where
meaningful. - **Domain vocabulary/configuration** --- labels and
templates customize presentation, but must not pretend that renaming a
family semantic makes it universally valid. - **Domain-specific
products** --- family, organization, alumni, academic lineage,
ownership/compliance, knowledge/skills, etc. can expose different
modules while sharing the same engine.

## Key Architectural Principle: Core + Modules

A capability belongs in the generic core only when its semantics are
broadly reusable.

Examples: - Generic: entity, edge, path, visibility, ownership,
contribution, event, media, location, search, audit. - Family module:
deceased/in-memoriam, birth/marriage anniversary semantics,
genealogy/kinship, ancestors/descendants. - Organization module:
reporting line, role history, department, headcount. - Ownership module:
ownership percentage, effective control, UBO chain. - Skills module:
prerequisite, proficiency/difficulty, learning path.

Do **not** implement `spouse = collaborator` or
`deceased = inactive employee` merely through labels when the semantics
differ. Move toward typed domain capabilities over time.

## Product Philosophy

Prefer simple, visual, human, invitation-driven, relationship-centric,
mobile-friendly and privacy-aware experiences. Older/non-technical users
must be able to participate.

For family audiences, usability and emotional warmth are core product
capabilities and potential defensibility—not final-stage polish. Validate
rendered phone and desktop journeys, use family language, and make the next
action obvious without exposing platform or governance terminology.

Avoid enterprise-dashboard complexity, LinkedIn-style profiles,
excessive settings, feature overload, speculative AI, and abstractions
without a concrete product need.

The technical platform roadmap is preserved, but paused until Family Releases 1
and 2 have been used by real families. Required privacy, integrity, performance
and deployment work continues invisibly because family trust is non-negotiable.

## Platform Thesis

The durable asset is not a family-tree UI. It is a privacy-aware
**relationship intelligence engine** capable of answering who/what is
connected, how they are connected, what changed over time, what the
viewer may see, who may change it, and what useful insight/action
follows.

## Monetization Thesis

Family can drive emotional engagement, retention, sharing and product
learning. Other verticals may provide stronger willingness to pay.
Validate both rather than prematurely choosing one.

Potential paths: 1. Family premium --- larger networks, storage, private
circles, premium exports/books, reunion/event tooling. 2.
Alumni/association SaaS --- branded directories, invitations, events,
admin workflows, member self-service. 3. Org/network SaaS ---
relationship maps, history, controlled collaboration. 4. Specialist
verticals --- academic genealogy, ownership/compliance, professional
communities. 5. Platform/white-label/embed/API later, only after the
core is stable and repeatable.

Every major phase should answer: **Does this improve user value,
defensibility, distribution, retention, or monetization evidence?**

## 2026-08-23 Strategic Product Thesis — From Feature-Rich to Investable

The near-term objective is no longer to maximize capability. It is to make the existing capability produce three observable outcomes:

- **Instant Family Magic:** personal value in under a minute through no-login exploration or frictionless joining/creation, My Family Line, relation-to-me clarity and emotional family context.
- **Living Family Loop:** a private family space that becomes more valuable as relatives return, confirm facts, add memories, celebrate milestones and invite others.
- **Defensible Business Proof:** a permission-aware relationship graph plus trust/governance, measurable family-level retention and organic expansion, scalable multi-family operations, and credible willingness-to-pay/adjacent-vertical evidence.

The investor/acquirer story must therefore be stronger than “we built a family tree.” The asset is a consumer-quality family product on top of a privacy-aware relationship intelligence platform, with structured relationship data that compounds as families participate.

AI is differentiated only when grounded in authorized relationship data. Generic chat or content generation is not the moat.


## Expanded platform vision — 2026-08-25

The long-term product is a **family-first Trusted Network Platform** composed as a capability tree:
- core primitives;
- reusable capabilities;
- intermediate domain layers;
- explicit vertical specializations.

Target product family includes Family, Alumni, Professional Associations, Enterprise Relationship Intelligence, Founder/Investor Networks, Clubs/Societies and Nonprofit/Volunteer Networks.

A future idea should be evaluated by asking:
> What is the lowest existing capability layer it can reuse, and what is genuinely unique?


## G0 architecture decision — 2026-08-25

The capability-tree vision is now an architecture contract, not only a future idea. The platform will use typed composition with explicit verticals. Reuse will be earned at the lowest semantically correct layer and proven by a second consumer. Family kinship will not become the universal graph model, and Alumni will not be implemented by relabeling parent/child/spouse. See `G0-TRUSTED-NETWORK-ARCHITECTURE-BLUEPRINT.md`.

## G1.1 architecture becomes executable — 2026-08-25

The G0 capability-tree decision now has its first physical code seam. Core owns a typed vertical contract; Family and Alumni are explicit definitions; app-shell owns composition. Family is still the only active product vertical and remains behaviorally unchanged. Alumni exists only as a typed skeleton with institutional-membership semantics.

This is deliberately stronger than `NETWORK_TEMPLATES`: labels may configure presentation, but relationship meaning, authorization, matching, conflict resolution and workflow semantics remain typed domain/capability code.

## G1.2 shared runtime is now separated from vertical product catalogs — 2026-08-25

Feature rollout is now a concrete example of the capability-tree rule: the mechanics of launch state, default evaluation and eligibility are reusable core runtime, while what the features *mean* belongs to each explicit vertical.

Family keeps its complete existing feature catalog and product language. Alumni proves the second-consumer contract with a separate hidden skeleton catalog rather than inheriting Family feature semantics. This is the pattern future capabilities should follow: share mechanics downward, keep meaning at the lowest semantically correct vertical/domain layer.

## G1.3 core membership semantics are now separated from Family profile claims — 2026-08-25

The platform now has an explicit distinction between **belonging to a network** and **being linked to a vertical-specific profile/entity inside that network**. A user↔network membership is Core; the current `member_id -> family_members` pointer is Family compatibility, not the future universal membership model.

That distinction is important for Alumni and future verticals: Alumni can reuse tenancy, role, active-network context and resource-policy mechanics without being forced to claim a kinship `family_member`. Vertical identity-link semantics will be introduced only where a real second consumer proves them.

G1.3 also adds a product-runtime integrity principle: frontend vertical catalogs and deployed backend registries must fail safely when temporarily out of sync. Platform Owner controls now surface migration drift rather than executing against unknown feature keys.


## G1.4 shared transport is now a capability boundary — 2026-08-25

The capability-tree architecture now extends through remote transport. Network context, launch/playground runtime and Platform Owner operations are reusable capability modules, while Family behavior continues through the stable `lib/remote.ts` compatibility surface.

This establishes an important platform rule: **sharing a capability does not require renaming the deployed database or forcing every existing caller to migrate at once.** We can move implementation ownership downward while keeping compatibility upward. Family-specific claiming, kinship, memories, admin and construction remain explicit until a second consumer proves the right contract.


## G2 identity and participation become shared capability contracts — 2026-08-25

The platform now distinguishes three concepts that Family previously exposed through one implementation shape: **account membership**, **vertical identity/profile**, and **participation lifecycle**. Shared identity/claiming/invitation/contribution mechanics are typed capability contracts; Family keeps its existing secure backend through adapters; Alumni is represented explicitly with institutional identity semantics and no Family persistence reuse.

This reinforces the platform thesis: reuse is earned at the lifecycle/mechanics layer while profile meaning and persistence remain vertical-specific. A future Alumni user may belong to the same Core network/membership runtime and use the same claiming/participation lifecycle without becoming a `family_member`.

G2 also establishes the new delivery cadence for architecture work: coherent High-effort G batches rather than micro-extractions. The next proof is G3, where the S3-A1 distributed intake workflow will be separated into reusable construction mechanics plus Family/Alumni domain adapters.


## G3 network construction becomes a shared lifecycle — 2026-08-25

The platform can now describe how a trusted network is assembled without making kinship the universal model. Source/session/access, staging, candidate identity resolution, decisions, conflicts, provenance, validation and commit are shared construction concepts; Family parent/child/spouse, generation/lineage rules and canonical Family graph commit remain explicit Family/Kinship semantics.

This is a major proof of the capability-tree thesis: **the workflow can be shared while the meaning and integrity rules remain vertical-specific**. Alumni now supplies institutional/batch/program construction semantics as a non-persistent second-consumer skeleton, proving the contract without forcing Alumni into `family_members`.

The next platform proof is G4: compose these capabilities through a cleaner vertical runtime/app shell so navigation, features, Guide, Playground, Launch Control and What's New can be vertical-owned without scattering Family assumptions through the shell.

## G4 app composition becomes vertical-owned — 2026-08-25

The platform now has a clean distinction between **what a vertical can do** and **how that vertical is assembled into the application**. Family registers its own navigation, Guide routing, Playground identity, launch bundles and What's New destinations; the app-shell validates and composes them. Alumni does not inherit Family surfaces by default and remains fail-closed until its real product experience exists.

This is the final major architecture proof before the second vertical: G5 should now build Alumni as a real product using the shared network, identity, participation, construction and app-composition seams rather than reopening Family internals.


## G6 proof — one platform, two product-quality verticals — 2026-08-25

Family + Alumni now provide the first concrete proof that the architecture is not merely reorganized Family code. The products share trusted-network mechanics, launch/runtime infrastructure and selected UX primitives, while preserving different identity models, relationship semantics, persistence and user value.

The product rule going forward is **shared quality system, vertical-specific experience**. Reuse topbars, navigation mechanics, metrics, search/filter shells, empty states, import/claim/invite patterns and platform controls where evidence proves they are common. Do not force Family memories/lineage or Alumni cohort/career concepts into a generic lowest-common-denominator screen.

G7 can productize the platform only from these proven seams and should make a third vertical cheaper without weakening Family or Alumni.


## G7 — Network OS vision now executable

The long-term architecture is no longer only a vision statement. G7 introduces executable primitives for configurable entities, affiliations, hierarchy projections, shared network activity and vertical templates.

The platform model is now:

`Generic Network Core → Shared Capability Engines → Vertical Templates/Adapters → Strong Vertical Products → Permission-aware Intelligence`

Family remains the kinship-first vertical. Alumni becomes the first affiliation-first vertical. Future Organization/Trust/Franchise/Education networks can prove additional relationship and non-person entity semantics without rewriting Core.

# G8 — Business vertical proof expansion

The Network OS now has five active vertical products: Family, Alumni, Organizational Intelligence, Business Trust and Franchise. This moves the platform beyond consumer/community proof into multiple B2B network structures while retaining one reusable foundation.

G8 validates that the same Network OS can model people-centric matrix organizations, trust-centric business ecosystems and geography/ownership-centric franchise systems without forcing those domains into Family or Alumni semantics.

The next strategic layer is Network Intelligence: permission-aware discovery and insights over affiliations, typed relationships, activity/history and network structure. Commercial packaging remains evidence-gated and may differ materially by vertical.

## 2026-08-26 Strategic commercial reset — outcome loops, not network software

G8.5 proved that the Generic Network OS can support five meaningful verticals, but the strategic review identified a more important truth: **buyers do not pay for graphs, directories, maps, activity feeds or generic AI. They pay for recurring outcomes.**

The shared commercial thesis is now:

> Turn a fragmented real-world network into a living operating system that helps people find the right knowledge, person, path, proof or next action—and gets smarter when the outcome is captured.

The product loop is **Find → Understand → Connect → Act → Capture → Improve**.

Near-term commercial priority is intentionally unequal:
1. Organizational Intelligence — expertise, ownership, dependency and knowledge-risk outcomes.
2. Franchise Network — distributed operational learning, support and consistency.
3. Business Trust — provenance-backed sourcing and warm introductions, incubated in bounded trusted networks.
4. Alumni — opportunity, mentoring and professional/community access.
5. Family — emotional flagship, trust/UX laboratory and independently validated consumer proposition.

No sixth vertical should be built before at least one existing vertical produces credible commercial evidence.

See `STRATEGIC-PRODUCT-REVIEW.md` and `FAMILY-TO-NETWORK-EXPERIENCE-MAP.md`.

## Post-G9 Integration Hypothesis — Evidence-Backed Living Organization

The next differentiation hypothesis is **evidence-backed autonomous network construction**.

The Network OS remains the system for structured entities, affiliations, verified typed relationships, projections, deterministic paths and governed network actions. The Knowledge Hub/RAG capability is a candidate source for unstructured ingestion, retrieval, evidence discovery, question telemetry and optional local-model synthesis.

The desired combined product is not "a graph plus a chatbot." It should continuously transform fragmented organizational knowledge into reviewable evidence and a living graph, then turn that graph back into better retrieval, risk detection and action.

A successful integration should make organizational onboarding dramatically easier and make answers materially better than either generic enterprise search or a static organizational directory.

## Strategic Thesis — Trusted Multi-Network Network Effect

The long-term commercial thesis is **not limited to the economics of any single vertical**. The larger opportunity is a **trusted multi-network operating layer** where people and organizations participate in multiple independently governed networks while retaining strong privacy, provenance and context.

A person may simultaneously belong to one or more Family Networks, a community/association network, an Alumni Network, a professional or business network, a Franchise/operator network, and future trusted networks not yet designed. Each network remains isolated, permissioned and independently manageable. The platform must not collapse them into one giant public social graph.

The compounding value comes when trusted networks can selectively interoperate through authorized discovery, introductions and cross-network context.

Example: **50 Maheshwari family networks → members verified inside their own families → families participate in a trusted Maheshwari community network → members can discover or request help for marriage, jobs, business, mentoring, trusted services, events or introductions**, while access remains governed by network/community permissions and provenance.

This is fundamentally different from noisy WhatsApp groups, open social feeds, single-purpose matrimonial sites, single-purpose professional networks, or public directories with weak identity/trust.

> **Less passive scrolling. More trusted, contextual value delivery.**

The moat hypothesis is **network effect + verified trust + reusable network infrastructure + multi-network identity + privacy-preserving interoperability**. Once a trusted network is populated, governed, enriched with relationships/history/knowledge and used for repeated real-world interactions, switching becomes increasingly costly because the value is in the accumulated network context—not just the UI.

## Master Company Direction — Trusted Networks by Context

The platform should preserve **purpose-specific isolated networks** rather than place every need in one universal destination.

Marriage belongs inside Family/Community contexts.
Business sourcing belongs inside trusted Business networks.
Operational learning belongs inside Franchise.
Professional knowledge belongs inside Organization.
Mentoring/referrals belong inside Alumni.

The common platform supplies reusable network primitives underneath while each vertical stays clean, purposeful and semantically correct.

The long-term thesis is not “one giant super app screen.” It is **one trusted operating layer for many independently governed networks**.


## 2026-08-28 — Product identity and two-axis Network OS model
The project began as a personal Family hierarchy application and has organically crossed into a reusable **Network OS product** backed by a common platform foundation. Use the following vocabulary going forward:
- Product: TrustWeave / Generic Network OS (working brand is provisional).
- Platform foundation: identity, membership, governed networks, privacy, consent, launch control, peer trust, future federation, runtime and intelligence seams.
- Applications/vertical products: Family, Alumni, Professional, Organization, Business Trust, Franchise, Community/Federation and future application products such as trusted matrimony.

The structural model is not one hierarchy. Both major dimensions are many-to-many:
`Person ↔ Network` and `Network ↔ Umbrella/Federation`. A person may participate in many unrelated networks; each network independently affiliates with appropriate domain umbrellas. M6 peer bridges remain a separate horizontal trust edge. NF federation must never imply child-graph disclosure.

Traction will determine product-market fit and whether this becomes a product company; traction is not required to accurately call the present reusable system a product.
