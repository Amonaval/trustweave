# TrustWeave — Complete Mission Journey

**Canonical sequence through E10**  
**Updated:** 2026-09-12

This is the centralized historical ledger requested for TrustWeave. It is **append-only**. Closed mission evidence is preserved in `archive/`; current product truth lives in `CURRENT-STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and the product documentation under `docs/product/`.

> Ordering note: the sequence below follows the preserved mission numbering, dependency chain and recorded handoffs. Where the historical artifacts did not record a reliable wall-clock date, this document preserves the exact logical execution sequence rather than inventing a date.

## Current frontier — Discovery & Product Exploration

**Outcome sought:** reveal TrustWeave’s existing power before asking users to sign in. Build a self-explaining anonymous landing, Chairman/President journeys, capability explorer, Playground-first proof and curated public-safe Doc Center.

Handover: `NEXT-MISSION-DISCOVERY-PRODUCT-EXPLORATION.md`

---

# What this journey means

The product did **not** jump from “family tree” directly to “huge platform.” It moved through a sequence:

**Family product → multi-family tenancy → reusable architecture → multiple vertical proofs → Network OS → intelligence experiments → product/runtime hardening → multi-network/federation → vertical specialization → cross-vertical parity → QA certification → showcase readiness → engagement/notification/media infrastructure.**

The next phase should therefore build on the engagement foundation, not start another parallel architecture.
<!-- FINAL-LAUNCH-CLOSURE -->
## Final pre-launch closure — Discovery, realistic data and launch certification

### 134. Discovery / Product Exploration transformation
**Outcome:** Replaced the anonymous sign-in-first impression with a public-safe product front door. Visitors can understand TrustWeave as a private multi-network OS, choose Housing Society / Family Community / member journeys, enter Playground, open a progressive Product Guide and then sign in when ready.

### 135. Final launch data + certification foundation
**Outcome:** Added bundled 25-flat Residential and 20-family Family Community datasets, a guarded network-scoped launch loader, lineage/idempotency migration, FCA annual-membership import closure, launch-specific source gate and staging runtime E2E specifications. Source closure is green; final dependency-backed lint/build and headed/mobile persisted-network certification remain the required go/no-go gate.

**Release artifacts:** `LAUNCH-READINESS-REPORT.md`, `PILOT-DEMO-RUNBOOK.md`, `DATA-SEED-RUNBOOK.md`, `RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`, `FINAL-RELEASE-MANIFEST.md`.

## 2026-09-15 — Seeded-network rehearsal hotfix
The first real seeded Residential rehearsal exposed live contract/UX defects that source-only certification had not proven. Migration **114** now restores the missing `hs4_get_operations_snapshot()` and `route_network_mentions(...)` RPCs, fixes the invalid funds `a.type` reference, makes explicit **Open Voting** open immediately, and decouples Storage authorization from profile active-network drift while preserving network membership isolation.

Housing Society UX was also restructured after real laptop use showed unacceptable information density: Manage Society now renders one categorized workspace at a time; Finance, Governance and Security have focused subsections; Housing More is grouped; and Appearance is reduced to a single **Classic / Modern / Dark** selector. These are launch-hardening changes, not new product scope.

**Runtime status:** source gates are green, but this hotfix is not considered proven until migration 114 is applied to the real/staging database and the reported operations/funds/voting/mentions/media paths are retested.
