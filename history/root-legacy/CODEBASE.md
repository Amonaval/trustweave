# G9 CODEBASE UPDATE

The Generic Network OS now contains `core/intelligence/` as a shared deterministic intelligence layer. `NetworkIntelligenceCenter` is the common UI boundary. Family and Alumni use thin adapters over their existing domain stores; Organization, Business Trust and Franchise consume the generic Network OS entity/affiliation/relationship contracts directly.

No unrestricted LLM data path has been added. Migration 049 only registers feature rollout state.

# Codebase — Family Release 1

## Current product state

This source is now intentionally **family-first**. Family Release 1 adds a warm
premium visual system, mobile-first shell, multilingual first-use journeys and a
guided Excel creation/import experience while preserving the P3–P5.1 tree,
profiles, timeline, governance, local/demo and Supabase paths.

Key Release 1 files:

- `app/globals.css` — forest/ivory/gold design tokens, application shell,
  onboarding, Excel assistant and responsive layouts.
- `lib/i18n.tsx` — persisted English/Hindi/Marathi language foundation.
- `components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx` — shared language control.
- `components/SetupScreen.tsx` — two-step family-only onboarding.
- `components/ImportModal.tsx` — generated multi-sheet workbook, sheet parsing,
  preview, friendly validation and confirmed import.
- `components/NetworkApp.tsx` — translated primary shell, family home and mobile navigation.
- `components/ProfileDrawer.tsx`, `components/AuthPanel.tsx` — family-first profile and joining presentation.
- `FAMILY-RELEASE-1.md` — delivered scope and release acceptance checklist.

Verification in this workspace: clean dependency install, TypeScript, Next.js
production build and 150-member demo integrity pass. Rendered browser QA is
explicitly open because the environment could not download a browser binary.
Staging migrations/RLS remain a production gate.

## P5.1 Living Network

P5.1 is implemented in migration `015_p5_1_living_network.sql`, `TimelineView`, `UpcomingWidget`, `ProfileForm`, and the repository adapters. The D1 family-experience pass updates `SetupScreen`, `NetworkApp`, `TreeView`, `ProfileDrawer` and responsive styles. The migration chain is `001`–`015`. See `P5.1-IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `P5.1-FAMILY-UX-AUDIT.md` and `MODEL-SELECTION-RULE.md`.

## P4.1 — Foundation, Trust & Adoption
- Database-level privacy for private contact fields.
- Relationship integrity: self-link, duplicate, orphan, generation-order and parent/child-cycle protection.
- Duplicate identity detection and import validation.
- Generalized change-request and audit model.
- Repository abstraction separating shared Supabase and local/demo persistence.
- Profile photo upload through Supabase Storage with file type/size validation.
- Secure, single-use, expiring member invitation links.
- Mobile bottom navigation introduced now; every P4 feature must remain mobile-usable.

## P4.2 — Relationship Intelligence & Human Profiles
- How am I related?
- Relationship paths and common ancestors.
- Branch discovery and relationship explanations.
- Simple life-event timeline.
- Profile visibility controls and profile improvements.

## P4.3 — Community, Memories & Discovery
- Member collaboration through the generalized change-request model.
- In-app notifications for reviewed contributions and invitation acceptance.
- Community memories/stories with optional media and visibility controls.
- Profile-attached memories shown in the member drawer.
- Advanced directory discovery: text, profession, city, generation, and living/deceased filters.
- Mobile Community area and responsive discovery/memory experiences.

## P4.4 — Intelligence, Geography, Export & Scale
- Family/branch analytics.
- Geographic intelligence.
- PDF/SVG/filtered exports.
- Server-side discovery and graph windowing for larger networks.
- Final performance and PWA refinement.

### Product constraints
- Do not turn profiles into LinkedIn-style resumes.
- Mobile usability is a continuous requirement, not a final polish pass.
- Preserve the existing P3 tree, directory, map, auth, import/export and demo/local mode.
- Avoid native mobile apps, AI, social feeds, chat and complex RBAC until demand justifies them.


## P4.2 roadmap

P4.2 — Relationship Intelligence & Human Profiles: shortest relationship paths, common ancestors/descendants, kinship explanations, simple life-event timelines, profile/contact visibility controls, and mobile-usable relationship/profile experiences.

## P4.3 implementation

P4.3 is implemented in the current source baseline. See `P4.3-IMPLEMENTATION.md` and migration `008_p4_3_community_discovery.sql`.

# P4 Production Hardening — completed 2026-08-20

Migration `010_p4_production_hardening.sql` closes all security findings from the P4 audit:
- Race-safe first-admin bootstrap (advisory lock)
- Visibility-safe member projection (admin-only profiles fully redacted)
- IDOR-safe life-event and memory reads (checks target member visibility)
- Invitation account reassignment protection
- Profile submission ownership enforcement (non-admin can only submit for own member)
- Audit RPC restricted to admins

TypeScript target corrected to `es2017` in `tsconfig.json`.

---

# P5 — Platform Phase

## P5.0 — Configurable Entity & Relationship Types (DONE)

**Migration:** `011_configurable_types.sql`

`network_settings` extended with:
- `entity_label`, `entity_label_plural` — e.g. "Member" / "Members" or "Employee" / "Employees"
- `level_label`, `level_label_plural` — e.g. "Generation" / "Generations" or "Seniority" / "Levels"
- `parent_label`, `child_label`, `peer_label` — e.g. "Parent"/"Child"/"Spouse" or "Manager"/"Direct Report"/"Co-founder"
- `network_template` — chosen at setup ("family", "org", "alumni", "academic", "corporate", "skills")

**Code:**
- `lib/network.ts` — `NetworkSettings` type extended, `getNetworkConfig(network)` helper, `NETWORK_TEMPLATES` array
- `lib/remote.ts` — `saveNetworkSettings` writes all new fields
- `components/SetupScreen.tsx` — template selector cards
- All UI components — use `cfg.entity_label` etc. instead of hardcoded strings

**Key rule:** DB structural types (`parent`/`child`/`spouse`) are unchanged — only display labels are configurable.

## P5 Storage Privacy Fix (DONE)

**Migration:** `012_private_storage.sql`
- Both buckets (`profile-photos`, `community-media`) flipped to `public: false`
- Public SELECT policies dropped; authenticated-only SELECT policies added

**Code:**
- `lib/storage.ts` — uploads return storage path (not URL); `resolveSignedUrls(items, bucket)` batch-signs 24h TTL; `getSignedPhotoUrl(path)` for single-file use
- `lib/remote.ts` — `fetchRemoteState` batch-resolves all member photo paths to signed URLs; `fetchMemories` does the same for memory photos
- `components/ProfileForm.tsx` — upload call updated (removed obsolete `ownerKey` param)

**Important for future PRs:** `photo_url` in the DB now stores the storage path (e.g. `profiles/uid/uuid.jpg`), not a full URL. All rendering uses signed URLs resolved at fetch time. Backward compat: `resolveSignedUrls` extracts the path from legacy full public URLs automatically.

## P5.1a — Shareable Public Page (DONE)

**Route:** `/public`

**Migration:** `013_public_page.sql`
- `get_public_network_info()` — returns name, description, labels; granted to `anon`
- `get_public_family_members()` — returns only `profile_visibility = 'public'` approved members (no contact, no photo); granted to `anon`

## P5-S0 Media Authorization + P5.1 Living Network (DONE IN SOURCE)

- `014_p5_s0_media_authorization.sql` replaces path-knowledge access with visibility/ownership-aware private media authorization.
- `015_p5_1_living_network.sql` adds the privacy-aware network timeline and target-free, safe-field self-edit RPC.
- Live staging application and role-matrix verification remain the release gate.
- The first D1 visual usability pass is recorded in `P5.1-FAMILY-UX-AUDIT.md`.

**Code:**
- `app/public/page.tsx` — Next.js route
- `components/PublicPage.tsx` — standalone public directory: network header, stats (members/generations/in memoriam), searchable member cards, "Sign in" CTA
- `components/NetworkApp.tsx` — "Public Page" card added to admin section with copy-URL and preview link

**Key rules:**
- Public page never shows photos (storage is private; anon can't get signed URLs)
- Only members with `profile_visibility = 'public'` appear
- No navigation, no auth, no admin tools — pure read-only

# Dev rules

- Always read this file before starting a session.
- See `P5-ACTIVE-PLAN.md` for the current task queue and next steps.
- Follow `MODEL-SELECTION-RULE.md` before substantial work and state the recommended model/effort.
- Follow `P5.1-FAMILY-UX-AUDIT.md`; rendered mobile/desktop usability is a release criterion.
- `photo_url` in DB is a storage path after 011/012; always call `resolveSignedUrls` at fetch time.
- Structural relationship types (`parent`/`child`/`spouse`) never change — only display labels are configurable.
- Do not add migration columns without DEFAULT values — existing rows must not break.
- Run `npm install && npm run build` before any production deployment to verify the full build.

# Current Development Compass

Read alongside this file:
- `PROJECT-VISION.md`
- `FOUNDER-COMPASS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `MISSION-STATUS.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md`
- `CODEBASE-UPDATE-RULE.md`
- `artifact/platform-vision.html`

## Active next mission
**P5-S0 — Security & Baseline Closure.**

Immediate priorities:
1. tighten authenticated Storage SELECT authorization and media visibility boundaries;
2. verify build and migration/RLS baseline;
3. then proceed to P5.1 Living Network.

## Architecture direction
Family remains the strongest vertical and proving ground. Evolve incrementally toward **shared relationship core + domain modules + configuration + focused vertical products**. Configurable labels are not generic semantics.

## Business direction
Sustainable monetization is a primary objective. Family may drive engagement/distribution; other verticals may offer greater willingness to pay. Roadmap decisions should generate evidence about both.

## 2026-08-23 — S1-C cumulative additions

- Migration `035_s1c_profile_submission_review.sql`: family-scoped profile-submission review RPC + Add Myself bootstrap.
- `components/QuickFamilyStart.tsx`: first-person/close-family progressive creation.
- `lib/demo-data.ts`: current 60-person / 5-generation rich showcase family with events and memories.
- New public import assets: guided workbook, 10-person workbook, 60-person showcase workbook and people-only CSV.
- S1-C regression gate: `scripts/s1-c-source-gate.mjs`.

## 2026-08-23 — S1 family access/showcase hardening
- Migration 036: `family_lobby_mode`, family lobby/leave RPCs, independent Playground feature settings/RPCs.
- `FamilySwitcher`: create/join another, family lobby, guarded leave.
- `SetupScreen`: existing-family recovery and sign out.
- `NetworkApp`: always-visible auth escape controls, Playground Explorer/feature map, local memories persistence fix.
- `FounderLaunchConsole`: Playground feature visibility panel independent of real-user rollout.
- `supabase/seed-demo.sql`: synchronized 60-person full-potential showcase; old 150-person filler seed removed from the active seed path.

## 2026-08-23 S1-D cumulative notes

- `NetworkApp.tsx`: `UsersRound` import retained; admin audience selector is now a scoped profile privacy preview.
- `ProfileDrawer.tsx`: preview audience filters profile details, contacts, social links, life events and memories; backdrop dismissal remains supported.
- Dismissible modal components now close only when the backdrop itself is activated, not when a control inside the dialog is used.
- `app/globals.css`: user-verified `.card { padding: 10px; }` and Home memory tile bottom spacing are canonical.

## 2026-08-23 — S2-A codebase update

Latest additive migration: `037_s2a_living_family_loop.sql`.

S2-A adds a Home Family Pulse capped at 1–3 relevant moments, memory reactions, family-scoped engagement events, and aggregate living-loop metrics. Primary affected runtime files: `components/FamilyHome.tsx`, `components/CommunityHub.tsx`, `components/ParticipationCenter.tsx`, `lib/types.ts`, `lib/remote.ts`, `lib/demo-data.ts`, and `app/globals.css`. S1 remains substantially verified with residual QA; S2-A remains live verify until deployed/pilot behavior is measured.

## S2-B Community umbrella
Migration `038_s2b_community_umbrella_discovery.sql`, `components/CommunityNetwork.tsx`, `lib/community-network-types.ts` and the S2-B remote functions provide hierarchical communities, governed family links, opt-in profile snapshots and community posts. `connect.community` now surfaces the Community Network UI. Direct cross-family family-table access is intentionally not used.

## S2-C additions
- `supabase/migrations/039_s2c_trusted_introductions.sql` — governed family trust edges, shortest family path RPCs and persisted introduction requests.
- `lib/community-network-types.ts` — trust/path/introduction types.
- `lib/remote.ts` — S2-C RPC clients.
- `components/CommunityNetwork.tsx` — Trusted Families and Introductions tabs, connection-path badges and request modal.
- `scripts/s2-c-source-gate.mjs` — source invariants for S2-C.
- `S2-C-TRUSTED-INTRODUCTIONS-CONNECTION-PATHS.md` — mission contract and live behavior gate.

## S2-D — Quiet Family Digest + Return Engine
- `components/FamilyDigest.tsx`: private Home digest and privacy-safe sharing.
- `components/FamilyHome.tsx`: mounts digest for Simple/Connected/Explorer and blocks demo engagement writes.
- `components/CommunityHub.tsx`: expanded quiet digest preference controls.
- `supabase/migrations/040_s2d_quiet_family_digest_return_engine.sql`: digest generation/state/preferences + return metrics.
- `lib/remote.ts`: digest/preference RPC clients.
- `components/ParticipationCenter.tsx`: digest opens/returns/shares in S2 loop scorecard.
- `scripts/s2-d-source-gate.mjs`: S2-D source invariant gate.

Note: migration `039_s2c_trusted_introductions.sql` is included again in the S2-D affected package because the prior S2-C packaging omitted that migration even though S2-C source depended on it.

## Planned next architecture — S2-E living help system
S2-E should introduce a central structured user-guide content layer plus reusable contextual guide, standalone Explore & Guide portal, deterministic guide search and governed product-feedback persistence/triage. Do not implement help as duplicated per-component prose. Detailed contracts live in `S2-E-GUIDED-FAMILY-EXPERIENCE-LIVING-HELP-SYSTEM.md` and `S2-E-COMPLETE-GUIDE-CONTENT-MAP.md`.

## S2-E — Guided Family Experience & Living Help System (implemented in source)

New architecture:
- `lib/guide-types.ts` — guide/feedback contracts.
- `lib/user-guide-content.ts` — central structured source of product-help truth, personas, goals, inspiration and future-interest inventory.
- `components/FeatureGuide.tsx` — reusable collapsible contextual help.
- `components/GuidePortal.tsx` — standalone `Explore & Guide` product-discovery portal and deterministic search UI.
- `components/GuideFeedback.tsx` — contextual helpfulness/improvement feedback.
- `supabase/migrations/041_s2e_guided_family_help_feedback.sql` — governed feedback storage/RPCs and Platform Owner aggregates/status changes.
- `scripts/s2-e-source-gate.mjs` — S2-E source invariant gate.

Integration:
- `components/NetworkApp.tsx` owns Guide navigation/routing and reuses the central registry for contextual help.
- `components/SetupScreen.tsx` exposes `Explore & Guide` to signed-in users who do not yet have an active family, using the safe sample context.
- `components/FounderLaunchConsole.tsx` includes Platform Owner feedback triage; feedback status does not mutate roadmap files.
- `lib/remote.ts` contains feedback submit/triage/aggregate RPC clients.
- `app/globals.css` includes responsive Guide layouts through the 390px breakpoint (360/390/430 behavior still requires device/browser verification).

## S2-E release closure additions — 2026-08-24

- `S2-E-RELEASE-CLOSURE.md` — honest source-complete vs live-certification boundary.
- `S3-BUSINESS-PROOF-DESIGN.md` — canonical S3 evidence/activation/retention/operations/defensibility/monetization design.
- `scripts/s2-e-release-closure-gate.mjs` — detects broken guide relationships and important nested contextual-guide regressions.
- Contextual `FeatureGuide` integration expanded into `ProfileDrawer`, `ImportModal`, `InvitationModal` and `RelationshipModal`.
- Guide registry now includes a Platform Owner-only Feedback Intelligence & Triage entry; all `related` guide references resolve to real registry entries.

## 2026-08-24 — Pilot-freeze codebase state

Launch Control now includes explicit feature keys for `core.guide`, `remember.family_pulse`, `remember.quiet_digest` and `connect.trusted_introductions`. Migration `042_s3a_pilot_launch_defaults.sql` establishes the recommended pilot baseline independently for real families and Playground. Family Pulse and Quiet Digest can be gated independently; trusted-introduction UI is separately gated inside the Community surface.

Active product mission: `S3-A-ACTIVATION-NETWORK-GROWTH.md`. Broad S3 implementation is intentionally paused for real-user evidence.

Historical/superseded planning material is being consolidated under `archive/history/`; canonical current docs remain at root.

## S3-A1 additions — 2026-08-25

Distributed intake is isolated from canonical family editing until Owner approval.
- Public route: `app/contribute/[token]/page.tsx`
- Mobile form: `components/FamilyBranchIntakeForm.tsx`
- Owner review/share modal: `components/FamilyIntakeAdmin.tsx`
- Types: `lib/family-intake-types.ts`
- Client RPC wrappers: S3-A1 section in `lib/remote.ts`
- Feature registry: `contribute.branch_intake` in `lib/features.ts`
- Database: `supabase/migrations/043_s3a1_distributed_family_intake.sql`
- Source gate: `scripts/s3-a1-source-gate.mjs`

Canonical `family_members` and `family_relationships` remain the destination; anonymous forms never write them directly. Keep future intake extensions proposal/staging-first.


## Documentation / release-governance rule — 2026-08-25

The repository now treats user-facing mission closure as a product contract, not an optional documentation task:

**IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → GUIDE → PLAYGROUND → LAUNCH CONTROL → WHAT'S NEW → ROADMAP/STATUS → CLOSE**

Canonical rule details live in `DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md`. Major mission documents must expose where the capability appears in the real product, Playground, Guide and Launch Control. Central guide content should be reused by contextual help where practical. Playground remains no-save. Launch visibility remains independent from code presence.

S3-A1 is currently **IMPLEMENTED IN SOURCE / CLOSURE PARTIAL / LIVE VERIFY REQUIRED** because Guide, Playground and What's New closure surfaces still need implementation.

## S3-A1 closure surfaces — 2026-08-25

S3-A1 now follows the permanent mission closure contract at source/UI level.

New/updated closure surfaces:
- `lib/user-guide-content.ts` — canonical `build-together` guide entry.
- `components/FeatureGuide.tsx` — full-guide action is now shown only when a destination callback exists, allowing the same contextual guide to be safely embedded in the public intake form.
- `components/FamilyIntakeAdmin.tsx` — contextual S3-A1 guide.
- `components/FamilyBranchIntakeForm.tsx` — contributor-facing contextual guide.
- `components/FamilyIntakePlayground.tsx` — new no-save/no-token/no-Supabase simulation.
- `components/NetworkApp.tsx` — routes guide/demo/feature announcements into real intake or simulated Playground appropriately.
- `components/GuidePortal.tsx` — S3-A1 What's New discovery.
- `components/FounderLaunchConsole.tsx` — explicit S3-A1 rollout/security/Playground explanation.
- `USER-GUIDE.md` — central owner/contributor instructions.
- `scripts/s3-a1-closure-source-gate.mjs` + `validate:s3-a1-closure` — closure regression contract.

Status: **UX CLOSURE COMPLETE / LIVE VERIFY REQUIRED**. The Playground component is intentionally separate from the real anonymous contribution RPC path.


## Strategic architecture direction — capability tree

Logical target:

```text
core/
capabilities/
domain-layers/
verticals/
apps/
```

This is a logical direction, **not** an instruction to move the whole repository immediately.

Likely shared capabilities:
- tenancy/network;
- identity/profile;
- membership;
- graph/relationships;
- invitations/claiming;
- distributed network construction;
- identity resolution;
- audit/provenance;
- relationship intelligence;
- discovery/introductions;
- groups/events/contributions/digest;
- Guide/Playground/Launch Control/What's New.

Likely Family specialization:
- genealogy;
- generations;
- ancestor/kinship semantics;
- deceased workflows;
- family-specific memories/language.

Likely Alumni specialization:
- institution;
- department/program;
- batch/year;
- alumnus/faculty semantics;
- career/mentorship/opportunity context.

Do not physically reorganize until G0 identifies stable boundaries and regression gates.


## G0 architecture classification — 2026-08-25

G0 is complete in `G0-TRUSTED-NETWORK-ARCHITECTURE-BLUEPRINT.md`. No runtime files were moved in G0.

Binding codebase direction:
- CORE: network tenancy, memberships, active-network context, authorization primitives, platform ownership and rollout runtime.
- SHARED CAPABILITY: claiming/invitations/privacy primitives, governed contribution, construction workflow, graph algorithms, Guide/Playground/Launch Control/What's New frameworks.
- INTERMEDIATE KINSHIP DOMAIN: parent/child/spouse, generation ordering, ancestry/lineage and kinship explanations.
- FAMILY VERTICAL: emotional Home, memories/history/deceased/special days, Family-specific intake language, Family admin/copy and kinship presentation.

Important remaining leaks to remove incrementally: `network_memberships.member_id` still references `family_members`; `Member` still mixes generic identity with Family-only fields; `NetworkRepository` remains Family-domain heavy; `lib/remote.ts` is now a partial compatibility facade but still contains substantial Family-domain transport; and legacy `NETWORK_TEMPLATES` still incorrectly imply domain semantics can be generalized by relabeling Parent/Child/Spouse. The former `lib/features.ts` mixed-runtime/catalog leak and the first identity/participation transport seams have been extracted.

G1.1–G1.4 established the first physical seams. The formerly planned G1.5 claiming work was absorbed into the consolidated G2 identity/claiming/participation batch. S3-A1 physical generalization is now explicitly deferred to consolidated G3.

## G1.1 physical architecture seam — 2026-08-25

New structure:

```text
core/verticals/contracts.ts
verticals/family/definition.ts
verticals/alumni/definition.ts
app-shell/vertical-registry.ts
scripts/g1-1-architecture-gate.mjs
```

Rules now enforced:
- core defines vertical contracts but does not import explicit vertical implementations;
- explicit verticals do not import each other;
- app-shell owns composition/registration;
- Family remains the default active vertical;
- Alumni remains a skeleton and must not reuse kinship semantics merely through labels;
- `vertical_kind` is currently a runtime compatibility field, not a required persisted database column;
- legacy `network_template` remains for compatibility until additive migrations are justified.

`components/SetupScreen.tsx` now obtains the existing Family setup labels through the Family vertical definition. Values are unchanged. `NETWORK_TEMPLATES` remains in `lib/network.ts` for compatibility and must not be treated as the new vertical architecture.

Run `npm run validate:g1.1` with the normal source gates before accepting architecture changes.

## G1.2 feature runtime / vertical catalog seam — 2026-08-25

New structure:

```text
core/features/contracts.ts
core/features/runtime.ts
verticals/family/features/catalog.ts
verticals/alumni/features/catalog.ts
verticals/family/definition.ts           # composes Family catalog
verticals/alumni/definition.ts           # composes hidden Alumni skeleton catalog
app-shell/vertical-registry.ts           # resolves vertical + feature catalog
lib/features.ts                          # legacy Family compatibility facade
scripts/g1-2-feature-runtime-gate.mjs
```

Architecture rule now enforced:
- core feature runtime owns mechanics only;
- feature keys/copy/defaults belong to vertical catalogs;
- core never imports Family/Alumni;
- Family and Alumni catalogs never import each other;
- app-shell composes vertical implementations;
- legacy Family callers may continue through `lib/features.ts` until migrated naturally;
- current database feature keys/RPC names remain unchanged.

The Family catalog contains the same 23 feature keys, bundle membership, experience thresholds and default launch states as before G1.2. Alumni catalog entries are hidden and are not wired to UI/database rollout.

Run `npm run validate:g1.2` plus the normal source gates. Use `G1.2-RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` for the short deployed smoke check.

## G1.3 neutral network/membership seam — 2026-08-25

New structure:

```text
core/network/contracts.ts
verticals/family/network/membership-adapter.ts
supabase/migrations/044_g1_3_feature_catalog_integrity.sql
scripts/g1-3-network-membership-gate.mjs
```

Important boundaries:
- Core `NetworkMembership` contains network identity, role/status, active state and resource policy only.
- `network_memberships.member_id` remains a Family database compatibility pointer and is represented only by the Family adapter in the new seam.
- `lib/remote.ts` still exports historical `NetworkMembership` + `fetchMyNetworks()` for Family UI, and now adds `fetchMyNetworkMemberships()` for neutral callers.
- `fetchNetworkSettings()` uses the neutral membership path internally.
- `AuthUser.family_role` remains supported while new neutral code may use `membership_role`.
- no membership schema/RPC rename occurred.

Feature registry integrity:
- migration 044 requires migration 043/S3-A1 first;
- it inserts only missing feature/Playground rows and preserves existing founder choices;
- Launch Control disables missing backend keys and labels them `Database update required`;
- bulk Playground controls operate only on backend-confirmed keys.

Run `npm run validate:g1.3` plus all historical gates. After deployment use `G1.3-RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` for the short smoke check.


## G1.4 remote capability seam — 2026-08-25

New structure:

```text
capabilities/network-context/remote.ts
capabilities/launch-runtime/remote.ts
capabilities/platform-ownership/remote.ts
lib/remote.ts                                  # historical compatibility facade
scripts/g1-4-remote-capability-gate.mjs
scripts/g1-4-remote-compatibility-exports.json
```

Rules now enforced:
- capability transport may depend on Core contracts/infrastructure but not root `verticals/*` implementations;
- neutral network-context transport does not expose `member_id`;
- existing Family callers continue importing from `lib/remote.ts`;
- all 147 historical G1.3 facade exports are compatibility-locked;
- Family-domain RPCs stay in the legacy/domain side until a real shared contract exists;
- deployed RPC names remain unchanged;
- the G1.3 frontend↔backend feature-catalog drift guard is protected during transport refactors.

G1.4 extracted network context, launch/playground runtime and platform ownership. G2 now adds shared identity/claiming/participation contracts and Family adapters while keeping the deployed Family backend unchanged.

Run `npm run validate:g1.4` plus all historical gates. Use `G1.4-RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` for the short deployed smoke check.


## G2 shared identity / claiming / participation seam — 2026-08-25

New structure:

```text
core/identity/contracts.ts
core/participation/contracts.ts
capabilities/identity-claiming/runtime.ts
capabilities/participation/runtime.ts
app-shell/vertical-capabilities.ts
verticals/family/identity/claiming-adapter.ts
verticals/family/participation/types.ts
verticals/family/participation/adapter.ts
verticals/alumni/identity/types.ts
verticals/alumni/identity/claiming-adapter.ts
verticals/alumni/participation/adapter.ts
lib/remote.ts                                  # stable Family compatibility facade
lib/participation-types.ts                     # stable Family type compatibility facade
scripts/g2-shared-identity-participation-gate.mjs
```

Binding boundaries:
- Core identity uses a `VerticalIdentityRef`; it does not universalize `member_id`.
- Account↔identity binding is a neutral contract; current Family persistence remains the legacy `profiles.member_id` / `network_memberships.member_id` implementation detail.
- Family verified-email claim adapter delegates to `get_my_claimable_profiles` + `claim_profile_by_verified_email` unchanged.
- Family invitation/contribution adapter delegates to the existing invitation/contribution/participation RPCs unchanged.
- Alumni identity expresses institution/program/department/graduation-year semantics and is an explicit unavailable skeleton until its own persistence/RLS exists.
- Alumni adapters must never call Family RPCs or use `family_members`.
- Family community groups/events remain Family/community semantics and were deliberately not generalized in G2.
- app-shell composes vertical adapters; shared capability runtimes do not import vertical implementations.
- all 147 historical `lib/remote.ts` exports remain compatibility-locked.
- G2 adds no migration.

Run `npm run validate:g2` plus every historical source gate. Use `G2-RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` only for the very short deployed smoke check. Full details: `G2-SHARED-IDENTITY-CLAIMING-PARTICIPATION-FOUNDATION.md`.

**G3 construction extraction is complete. Next consolidated architecture batch: G4 — Vertical Runtime & App Composition.**


## G3 network-construction seam — 2026-08-25

New structure:

```text
core/construction/contracts.ts
capabilities/construction/runtime.ts
verticals/family/construction/types.ts
verticals/family/construction/adapter.ts
verticals/alumni/construction/types.ts
verticals/alumni/construction/adapter.ts
app-shell/vertical-capabilities.ts
lib/remote.ts                         # Family compatibility facade
lib/family-intake-types.ts            # Family type compatibility facade
scripts/g3-network-construction-gate.mjs
scripts/g3-accepted-source-baseline.txt
```

Binding boundaries:
- shared construction owns lifecycle/envelope/provenance/validation/commit mechanics, not Family relationship meaning;
- Family S3-A1 SQL remains the authoritative scoring/kinship graph/atomic commit implementation;
- all historical `family_intake_*` RPC names remain unchanged inside the Family adapter;
- current Family S3-A1 UI continues importing from `lib/remote.ts` and `lib/family-intake-types.ts`;
- Alumni construction is institutional and persistence-disabled; it may not use Family tables/RPCs/parent-child-spouse/generation semantics;
- app-shell composes Family/Alumni construction runtimes; Core/shared modules never compose verticals;
- `network.construction` is now a typed capability;
- G3 adds no migration.

Run `npm run validate:g3` plus every historical gate. Use `G3-RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` for the short deployed smoke. Full details: `G3-NETWORK-CONSTRUCTION-ENGINE-EXTRACTION.md`.

**G4 subsequently completed. Current next batch: G5 — Alumni Network V1.**

## G4 — Vertical Runtime & App Composition — 2026-08-25

New composition layer:

```text
core/verticals/app-composition.ts
app-shell/vertical-runtime.ts
verticals/family/runtime/composition.ts
verticals/alumni/runtime/composition.ts
```

Key ownership after G4:
- `core/verticals/contracts.ts` — vertical identity/capability/catalog contract only; no UI navigation registry.
- `app-shell/vertical-runtime.ts` — composition root and integrity validation.
- Family runtime composition — current Family navigation, Guide routing, Playground metadata, Launch Control bundles and What's New routing.
- Alumni runtime composition — explicit skeleton with no Family surfaces and no user-visible renderer.
- `components/NetworkApp.tsx` and `FounderLaunchConsole.tsx` remain the stable Family renderers and consume registered metadata.

Compatibility: all 147 historical remote exports, all 23 Family feature keys/defaults, G2 identity/participation seams, G3 construction seams, S3-A1 RPCs and Family UX behavior are preserved. G4 adds no migration.

## G5 vertical dispatch invariant

`lib/features.ts` remains a Family compatibility facade. Therefore shared host code must never pass Alumni feature keys into it. `NetworkApp` now performs the active Alumni handoff before Family feature derivation and guards the Family `hasFeature` helper with `activeVerticalKind === "family"`. Keep the unknown-feature exception strict; future verticals must use their own catalog/runtime instead of weakening the guard.


## G6 two-vertical UX and isolation seam — 2026-08-25

New shared presentation boundary:

```text
components/shared/NetworkTopbar.tsx
components/shared/NetworkSwitcher.tsx
components/shared/NetworkUi.tsx
```

Rules after G6:
- shared UI primitives may express network-neutral chrome/layout/state, but never Parent/Child/Spouse or Alumni cohort semantics;
- Family and Alumni may share primitives while owning their own page composition and domain copy;
- shared NetworkSwitcher uses `fetchMyNetworkMemberships()` rather than the legacy Family membership row;
- `NetworkApp` must hand Alumni off before any Family compatibility feature evaluation;
- each active vertical evaluates its own feature catalog; the Core unknown-feature exception remains strict;
- Platform bundle rollout is vertical-scoped because bundle names are not globally unique across verticals;
- Alumni tenant links are protected by composite profile/network foreign keys;
- Family identity/participation/construction/catalog/composition foundations are protected during G6 by hashes from the certified G5 baseline.

G6 migration: `046_g6_two_vertical_hardening.sql`.

Run `npm run validate:g6` plus historical gates. See `G6-TWO-VERTICAL-PROOF-SHARED-UX-HARDENING.md`.

## G7 Generic Network OS layer — 2026-08-25

```text
core/network-os/contracts.ts
core/templates/contracts.ts
core/templates/runtime.ts
core/templates/catalog.ts
capabilities/affiliation/runtime.ts
capabilities/affiliation/remote.ts
capabilities/activity/runtime.ts
capabilities/activity/remote.ts
app-shell/network-os-runtime.ts
app-shell/template-registry.ts
components/shared/NetworkProjectionExplorer.tsx
components/shared/NetworkActivityHub.tsx
verticals/family/template.ts
verticals/alumni/template.ts
templates/*/definition.ts
supabase/migrations/047_g7_generic_network_os.sql
```

The generic registry/affiliation layer sits **beside** authoritative vertical stores. Alumni currently has the first sync adapter through database trigger `trg_g7_sync_alumni_profile`. Family kinship is intentionally not written into generic affiliation semantics.

Active product templates remain Family + Alumni. Organization, Business Trust, Franchise, Education, Professional, Association, Residential, Supply Chain, Investor, Customer Intelligence and Custom Network are template proofs/future definitions only.

## G8 productized business vertical runtime — 2026-08-25

New released vertical structure:

```text
components/TemplateNetworkApp.tsx
capabilities/template-product/
templates/productized/config.ts
verticals/organization/
verticals/business-trust/
verticals/franchise/
templates/organization/
templates/business-trust/
templates/franchise/
supabase/migrations/048_g8_productized_verticals.sql
```

Organization, Business Trust and Franchise are active products rather than future template proofs. They reuse the G7 Network OS affiliation/projection/activity layers and one productized UX/runtime shell, while each owns feature catalog, app composition, dimensions, projections, relationship vocabulary and domain copy.

Identity/member boundaries after G8:
- imported entity email can enable verified-email claiming;
- one account can own at most one claimed entity per productized network;
- members can edit only their claimed entity; admins can manage network entities;
- productized owner/admin member-management RPCs are restricted to Organization/Business Trust/Franchise;
- member removal clears stale active-network context and claimed owner link.

G8 migration: `048_g8_productized_verticals.sql` after 047.

## G8 R4 Product Experience additions

Shared UI/runtime additions:
- `components/ThemeProvider.tsx` — persisted `light | dark | aurora` root appearance state.
- `components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` — shared compact/full appearance control.
- `components/shared/NetworkPulse.tsx` — reusable living-network summary for productized G8 Home.

Updated consumers:
- `app/layout.tsx` — root ThemeProvider.
- `components/shared/NetworkTopbar.tsx` — cross-vertical appearance control.
- `components/SetupScreen.tsx` — five-product Playground gallery and theme control.
- `components/TemplateNetworkApp.tsx` — corrected shared nav classes + Network Pulse.
- `app/globals.css` — responsive shell, Playground gallery and Light/Dark/Aurora surfaces.

No new persistence/schema migration was introduced by R4.

## G8.5-A documentation + product-depth governance — 2026-08-25

Historical mission/release Markdown is now stored under `archive/docs/` rather than the repository root. `scripts/*accepted*baseline.txt` uses the archived paths so append-only historical evidence remains enforced instead of being deleted. `scripts/archive-legacy-docs.mjs` is the idempotent archive normalizer.

Two G5 certification artifacts referenced by later accepted baselines but missing from the R4 ZIP were restored under `archive/docs/g0-g6/`.

New operating artifacts:

```text
GENERIC-CAPABILITY-UTILIZATION-RULE.md
G8.5-A-CAPABILITY-APPLICABILITY-MATRIX.md
G8.5-A-BASELINE-CLEANUP-AUDIT.md
G8.5-A-RUNTIME-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md
G8.5-A-RELEASE-MANIFEST.md
ARCHIVE-INDEX.md
scripts/g8-5a-clean-audit-gate.mjs
```

Architecture/product rule: a capability that is semantically applicable to another vertical must be reused by default or explicitly excluded/deferred. A vertical is not Productized merely because a route/feature key exists; applicable mature shared capabilities must be usable and demonstrable.

G8.5-A changes no production runtime and adds no migration. G8.5-B is responsible for capability extraction/integration.

## G8.5-B shared product-depth layer
`components/shared/NetworkGeography.tsx`, `NetworkRelationshipExplorer.tsx` and `NetworkEntityDetail.tsx` are now reusable product-experience primitives for productized verticals. `TemplateNetworkApp.tsx` composes them using template labels/relationships instead of embedding domain-specific copies.


## G8.5-C showcase layer
`templates/productized/config.ts` now carries meaningful read-only showcase datasets for Organization, Business Trust and Franchise (36 primary entities each) while `components/AlumniNetworkApp.tsx` carries a 36-profile Alumni showcase. `components/TemplateNetworkApp.tsx` renders shared What's New, guided showcase journeys and Guide proof from vertical configuration. `scripts/g8-5c-five-vertical-showcase-gate.mjs` protects minimum five-product showcase depth. Family continues to use its existing 60-member rich demo; no Family semantics were extracted into unrelated verticals. No schema migration was added.

## G8.6-A/B additions

Shared outcome-experience components:
- `components/shared/NetworkStructureView.tsx` — projection-backed visual hierarchy/structure map.
- `components/shared/NetworkEntityDetail.tsx` — 360° contextual entity action modal.
- `components/shared/NetworkKnowledgeHelpHub.tsx` — reusable knowledge/help/community-value layer.
- `components/shared/NetworkRelationshipExplorer.tsx` — focused connection entry from an entity.

Productized configuration now owns domain-native outcome language rather than generic placeholders. Alumni consumes the shared structure/knowledge components through explicitly bounded augmentation regions so the protected Alumni runtime core remains regression-checkable.

## G8.6-C codebase update
Added shared `NetworkOutcomeHome` and `NetworkMatureGuide`. Productized business verticals and Alumni now expose outcome-oriented Home/return experiences and platform-owner Launch Control. `FounderLaunchConsole` accepts `initialVertical` so embedded launch access opens on the active product. No persistence migration was required.

## G9 runtime certification additions
- `scripts/g9-intelligence-runtime-smoke.mjs` executes the real transpiled deterministic engine against representative Organization, Franchise and Business Trust datasets.
- `npm run validate:g9-runtime` is now part of `npm run validate:g9`.
- `core/intelligence/engine.ts` now handles single-target introduction questions by surfacing known typed relationships into the target or explicitly reporting that no verified warm path exists.
- See `G9-INTELLIGENCE-HOW-IT-WORKS.md` and `G9-RUNTIME-CERTIFICATION-COMMERCIAL-REALITY-GATE.md`.



## 2026-08-27 — Post-Mission-3 Runtime Architecture Decision

The current Next.js + Supabase + Vercel architecture is considered a valid managed/serverless backend, not an architectural failure. The next maturity gap is an **application-owned server/command boundary**, not a wholesale backend rewrite.

**Mission 4 — Network OS Application & Runtime Foundation** is the next recommended major mission at **MEDIUM effort**. It will introduce a modular TypeScript `server/` layer, versioned Next.js `/api/v1` command endpoints, server-side Supabase adapters, shared mobile-portable contracts, command/query classification, an observability seam and a GitHub Actions CI baseline. Supabase Postgres/Auth/Storage/Realtime/RLS remain core infrastructure.

Do not add microservices, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, a dedicated graph database, native mobile, or RAG expansion as part of Mission 4. Extract only 3–5 high-value multi-step/privileged commands and preserve safe direct RLS-protected queries.

See `NETWORK-OS-BACKEND-RUNTIME-ARCHITECTURE.md` and `MISSION-4-APPLICATION-RUNTIME-FOUNDATION.md`.
