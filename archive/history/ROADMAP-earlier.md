# Family Product Roadmap — Platform Vision Preserved for Later

## Binding priority — ship to families first

The immediate product is **not an enterprise relationship platform**. It is a
lovely, fast, multilingual and mobile-first family space that ordinary relatives
can use without training. Platform extraction, second verticals, multi-network
SaaS, billing and enterprise operations remain in this document for future use,
but must not delay adoption by real families.

Every near-term deliverable must be visible in the UI or directly improve user
trust, speed or reliability. A backend-only capability is not a family-product
mission unless it is required to release safely.

## Family Release 1 — Create, Explore and Join ✅ source complete

Delivered in this source:

- warm premium family theme and consistent visual tokens;
- mobile-first application shell, icon navigation and responsive layouts;
- English, Hindi and Marathi language foundation across setup, Excel guidance,
  primary navigation, family home and key profile actions;
- two-step first-time family setup with platform/vertical terminology removed;
- downloadable guided Excel workbook with Family Members, Relationships,
  Read Me and realistic example data;
- guided upload, people preview, friendly relationship validation and explicit
  confirmation before import;
- family home hero, simple primary actions and family-first labels;
- refreshed sign-in, profiles, tree, directory and supporting states.

Release before inviting families: run the real-device visual checklist, apply
migrations `001`–`015` to staging, execute the role/privacy matrix, deploy and
complete a small non-technical family usability test. See `FAMILY-RELEASE-1.md`.

## Family Release 2 — Remember, Connect and Celebrate

After Release 1 is in family hands, deliver memories/stories, living activity,
birthdays and anniversaries, guided contributions, WhatsApp-first invitations
and sharing, QR/printable cards and a lightweight family-gathering experience.
Measure joining, completed profiles, contributions, sharing and return visits.

## Later — technical and commercial platform roadmap

The previous D2/D3 roadmap is retained below. Resume it only after real family
usage is observed and the founder deliberately reopens platform expansion.

## D1 — Production Participation Release ✅ source complete / live gate pending

P5.1 living-network UX and P5.2 participation/distribution are implemented through migration `016`. Bulk invitations, claiming, contributions, QR/deep links/embed, group/reunion validation and success metrics are included. See `D1-IMPLEMENTATION.md`; live closure follows `D1-RELEASE-GATE.md`.

## Binding execution packaging — three deliverables

1. **D1 Production Participation Release:** remaining P5-S0 staging/RLS gate, P5.1 family-experience baseline, and all P5.2 invitation, contribution, QR/public/embed, group and reunion validation work.
2. **D2 Vertical Proof & Commercial Validation:** P5.3 core/module architecture plus P5.4 family, alumni/association and one B2B willingness-to-pay experiment. The second vertical must have real semantics, not renamed family concepts.
3. **D3 Multi-Network SaaS:** P6 first-class tenancy, network roles/dashboard, plans/limits, branding/embed, observability, backup and tenant migration. Start only after D2 establishes a credible paid ICP.

## Current Position --- August 2026

P3 established the hierarchy product. P4 added trust/governance,
adoption, relationship intelligence, profiles, community/memories,
discovery, analytics/geography/export and scale foundations. Migration
`010` hardened major IDOR/ownership/audit issues.

Early P5 shipped: - configurable vocabulary/templates (`011`); - private
Storage + signed URL path (`012`); - shareable anonymous public page
(`013`).

Current caveats: - live staging migration and role-matrix verification remain; -
the platform is configurable vocabulary over a family-centric schema, not
yet a fully generic domain model.

# Immediate Roadmap

## P5-S0 --- Security & Baseline Closure

**Goal:** make the current baseline safe to extend.

Deliver: - tighten Storage object authorization so private/admin media
cannot be fetched merely by knowing an object path; - validate
signed-media access against entity/memory visibility; - clean
`npm install` / `npm run build`; - apply migrations 001--015 on clean
staging; - exercise anon/member/admin/invited-user RLS journeys; -
update production-readiness status.

**Exit:** no known P0 security/build/migration blocker.

## P5.1 --- Living Network

**Goal:** turn static hierarchy data into an ongoing human experience.

Deliver: - privacy-aware network-wide timeline; - upcoming
birthdays/anniversaries/milestones only for domains where those
semantics apply; - controlled member self-edit; - field-aware
governance: low-risk profile fields may direct-save when configured;
identity/relationship/governed fields remain reviewed; - mobile-complete
experience.

Family value: collective history and reasons to return. Platform value:
generic event-stream + ownership/edit primitives.

Delivered D1 UX baseline: family-first progressive setup, warm home context,
plain family language, mobile contribution access/navigation repair, large-tree
guidance, better profile/timeline states and rendered desktop/mobile validation.

## P5.2 --- Participation & Distribution ✅ source complete

**Goal:** make contribution and sharing self-propagating.

Deliver: - invitation/claim flow at scale; - QR/public profile cards
where visibility permits; - group connection view; - contribution
prompts for missing information; - public/embed hardening; - lightweight
reunion/event use-case validation.

Measure invite acceptance, contributed data, shares and return visits.

## P5.3 --- Modular Domain Architecture

**Goal:** evolve from labels to a real core + vertical-module
architecture.

Deliver: - define generic entity/edge/event capabilities; -
capability/module registry; - family module: genealogy,
deceased/in-memoriam, kinship, family milestones; - prove one second
vertical with real semantics; - prevent new family-specific assumptions
in generic services; - design a safe migration path away from `family_*`
persistence without a big-bang rename.

Candidate validation verticals: alumni/associations first; organization
or ownership depending customer evidence.

## P5.4 --- Commercial Validation

**Goal:** prove willingness to pay before expensive platformization.

Run parallel experiments for: - family premium; - alumni/association
paid network; - one B2B specialist vertical.

Add only minimal infrastructure needed to test pricing/limits. Track
activation, retained networks, invitations, contributions, admin effort,
usage, conversion intent and paid pilots.

**Exit:** at least one vertical has credible paid demand and a defined
ICP.

# Vision Roadmap

## P6 --- Multi-Network SaaS

Only after commercial evidence: - first-class `network_id` tenancy; -
network dashboard/switching; - network-scoped roles and tenant-safe
RLS; - plans/limits; - branded/public/embed options; -
observability/backups.

## P7 --- Focused Domain Products

**Family/Heritage:** genealogy-grade lineage, private circles,
stories/documents, reunions, heritage exports/books, geographic
journeys.

**Alumni/Associations:** directory, batches/chapters, mentorship,
events, contribution campaigns, branded portals.

**Organization/Relationship Mapping:** reporting structures, role
history, controlled directories and organizational insight.

**Ownership/Specialist Networks:** typed ownership edges, percentages,
control chains and historical ownership when market evidence justifies
it.

## P8 --- Relationship Intelligence

After data quality and permissions mature: - semantic/network-aware
search; - natural-language questions over authorized graph data; -
anomaly/suggestion engine; - relationship-aware recommendations; -
generated histories/summaries grounded in source records; -
domain-appropriate graph analytics.

AI must remain permission-aware and evidence-grounded.

## P9 --- Platform / Ecosystem

Only when multiple products repeatedly need it: - stable API; -
integrations/webhooks; - embeddable components; - import connectors; -
white-label; - partner/developer capabilities.

The platform should emerge from repeated product needs, not precede
them.

## Deliberately Postponed

Premature universal schema rewrite, complex enterprise RBAC, native
mobile apps, social feed/chat, broad AI assistant, marketplace/ecosystem
and full billing platform before paid-demand validation.
