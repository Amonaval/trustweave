# Generic Network OS — Current State

**Updated:** 2026-08-27  
**Purpose:** compact operational truth. Keep this short; move history to roadmap/status/archive.

## Product

Six product verticals exist on the Generic Network OS foundation:
- Family
- Alumni
- Organizational Intelligence
- Business Trust
- Franchise
- Trusted Expertise & Professional Network

Family is the strongest real-user/product-quality proving ground. The platform already contains substantial cross-cutting capability: structured networks, vertical runtime/composition, claiming/membership foundations, participation, guides, Playground/showcase support, themes/mobile work, internationalization foundations, community concepts, trusted introductions and network intelligence experiments.

## Architecture direction

- Core + reusable capabilities + explicit vertical semantics.
- Network isolation is non-negotiable.
- Membership and network-scoped profile/entity are distinct concepts.
- Prefer additive, decoupled modules and preserve existing standalone behavior.
- One person may eventually participate in many isolated networks through a trusted identity layer.

## Intelligence status

G9/G9.1 demonstrated Network Intelligence plus a decoupled Network OS ↔ Knowledge Hub/RAG integration hypothesis.

**Decision:** park further intelligence-quality hardening until real data, repeated usage and meaningful evidence justify re-entry. Preserve the foundations; do not make RAG/Ollama mandatory for Network OS.

## Strategic focus now

1. Raise the product from capable to **remarkable/self-explanatory**, exposing substantially less UI.
2. Preserve the Family signature direction (**My Family, Through Me** + **One Family Moment**) without allowing Family to consume the entire roadmap.
3. Evaluate globally relevant commercial verticals, beginning with **Professional Expertise & Referral** and **Industry / Trade Ecosystem** concepts; treat Healthcare Provider Collaboration as high-potential/higher-regulation.
4. Treat complete internationalization, mobile-first/native portability and accessibility as product-quality gates.
5. Evolve hierarchy into a broader typed graph platform only when validated use cases require it; never create a universal readable graph.
6. Prefer institutional-anchor distribution and measurable paid outcomes over expensive founder-by-founder persuasion.
7. Reconcile the Network Effect track with this broader portfolio before selecting the next implementation mission.

## NE track snapshot

- **NE-1:** Multi-Network Identity & Membership Experience
- **NE-2:** Trusted Network-to-Network Linking
- **NE-3:** Cross-Network Discovery & Introductions
- **NE-4:** Community Umbrella Model
- **NE-5:** Mass Onboarding & Network Seeding
- **NE-6:** Organic Growth Engine
- **NE-7:** Product Storytelling / Market Education
- **NE-8:** Network Operations & Institutional Anchor Growth

The sequence is **not automatically accepted**. Before implementation, compare it with current code/contracts and challenge dependencies, privacy boundaries and product value.

## Current product consolidation

NX-1 through NX-5 established the first Network OS home plus Family return, preservation, participation and belonging loops. **NX-6 is the current consolidation milestone:** reduce feature-stack UX, unify navigation/account controls, simplify profiles and make My Networks + Family Home explain themselves through experience. Runtime verification is still milestone-based. No new schema/RLS/cross-network exposure is introduced by NX-6.

## Validation / release discipline

For meaningful missions use the existing lifecycle:

**IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → GUIDE → PLAYGROUND (where useful) → LAUNCH CONTROL → WHAT'S NEW → ROADMAP/STATUS → CLOSE**

Deliver affected/new files only where practical and preserve repository hierarchy.

## NX-1 — current implementation
- `My Networks` is now a first-class cross-vertical experience.
- The signed-in account acts as the minimum trusted-person anchor; no global profile merge is introduced.
- Network-local profiles/entities remain vertical-owned and privacy-isolated.
- Family shell now uses the neutral cross-vertical switcher.
- My Networks includes a five-vertical Playground entry and explicit identity/privacy explanation.
- Neutral membership projection now preserves all five registered `vertical_kind` values.

## NX-2 current product state
Family Home now includes an additive Living Family loop: a daily meaningful family action, graph-aware relative rediscovery, generational connection and preservation signals. It reuses existing Family data/permissions and introduces no new persistence or cross-network exposure. Runtime milestone verification remains pending.

## NX-3 current product state
Family Home now includes Family Time Machine & Generational Legacy: evidence-bound eras from existing births/life events/memories plus a preservation-risk layer showing what family context may otherwise be lost. No generated history, schema migration or cross-network exposure. Runtime milestone verification remains pending.

## NX-4 current product state
Family Participation now starts with a Family Growth Relay: one prioritized useful gap, relationship-aware context, privacy-safe “ask someone” hand-off, and a direct admin seam into secure invitations. Existing governed contribution/claiming permissions remain authoritative; no schema or cross-network change. Runtime milestone verification pending.

## NX-5 current product state
Family Home now includes Family Connection & Belonging: a relationship-aware wider-family spotlight, plain-language kinship, a clickable `You → … → relative` path, and derived Family Circles for generation/place/close-family context. It reuses current Family graph data only; no new persistence, contact exposure or social-feed mechanics. Runtime milestone verification pending.

## NX-6 current product state
Family is recomposed around **Today · People · Legacy** rather than a long stack of mission surfaces. Global account actions now share one menu across Family, Alumni and productized verticals; profiles use focused Overview · Story · Family tabs; My Networks hides secondary Playground/privacy detail until requested. NX-6 is a presentation/composition milestone, not a new data capability. Source/regression gates pass; runtime WOW verification remains pending.

## STABILITY-1 — current working rule
- Mission 1 large Home/navigation redesign is reverted; accepted post-NX UI remains the baseline.
- Only contained fixes are being applied.
- New i18n runtime uses separate locale catalogs and dynamic locale loading; legacy inline locale copy remains migration debt and must not be expanded.
- `window.nxFeatures = true` opens NX Review Mode for NX-1→NX-6 surface comparison without removing underlying modern architecture.
- Playground now provides an explicit route back to network selection.


## Mission 2 — current product state
Trusted Expertise & Professional Network is now the sixth registered vertical and the first explicit commercial-vertical proof after STABILITY-1. It reuses the productized-template engine with professional specialties, services, credentials, geography, trusted referral/collaboration relationships, practice groups and de-identified case knowledge. A 36-professional global Playground demonstrates the concept across multiple regions. Mission 2 source gate and STABILITY-1 regression gate pass; live Next.js/runtime verification remains open.

## i18n current state
English remains the canonical token contract. Hindi and Marathi are separate catalogs and are now key-complete for the current 328-token catalog. Legacy visible literals still exist outside catalogs; `npm run audit:i18n` tracks extraction debt and future missions must reduce it screen-by-screen rather than through a destabilizing mass rewrite.

## Mission 3 update — Governed Graph + Institutional Bootstrap
- Mission 3 is source implemented; runtime verification remains open.
- Network OS now has additive typed graph/governance contracts while preserving existing hierarchy/projection behavior.
- Productized Admin now exposes an Institutional Bootstrap panel that reuses import, join code, claiming, membership and delegated admin flows.
- i18n extraction reached 1,933 canonical English tokens with 351 reviewed Hindi and Marathi overrides; untranslated tokens fall back to English.
- AST visible-literal audit is zero for enforced user-visible TSX categories.


## 2026-08-27 — Post-Mission-3 Runtime Architecture Decision

The current Next.js + Supabase + Vercel architecture is considered a valid managed/serverless backend, not an architectural failure. The next maturity gap is an **application-owned server/command boundary**, not a wholesale backend rewrite.

**Mission 4 — Network OS Application & Runtime Foundation** is the next recommended major mission at **MEDIUM effort**. It will introduce a modular TypeScript `server/` layer, versioned Next.js `/api/v1` command endpoints, server-side Supabase adapters, shared mobile-portable contracts, command/query classification, an observability seam and a GitHub Actions CI baseline. Supabase Postgres/Auth/Storage/Realtime/RLS remain core infrastructure.

Do not add microservices, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, a dedicated graph database, native mobile, or RAG expansion as part of Mission 4. Extract only 3–5 high-value multi-step/privileged commands and preserve safe direct RLS-protected queries.

See `NETWORK-OS-BACKEND-RUNTIME-ARCHITECTURE.md` and `MISSION-4-APPLICATION-RUNTIME-FOUNDATION.md`.

## Mission 4 — Application & Runtime Foundation
Source implemented on 2026-08-27. Network OS now has an additive application-owned command boundary using Node-runtime Next.js Route Handlers, modular TypeScript server services, shared API contracts and user-JWT Supabase access. Five commands are extracted: network create, network join, graph relationship create, institutional bootstrap/import and identity claim. Existing screens and compatibility transport signatures are preserved; safe RLS-backed reads remain direct. CI baseline is added. Runtime/build verification remains open because project dependencies were unavailable in the execution environment.


## Mission 5 — Production & Operational Runtime
Source implemented on 2026-08-28. The Mission 4 command boundary now runs through a shared production runtime wrapper with bounded JSON parsing, payload limits, authenticated burst protection, normalized command logging, durable Supabase-backed idempotency for network creation/institutional bootstrap, health/readiness endpoints, centralized runtime config, and an honest background-job seam. CI now includes M5 regression, TypeScript and production build gates. No microservices/Redis/Kafka/service-role runtime was introduced. Runtime/deployment verification remains open.


## Mission 6-A — Trusted Identity Unification + Cross-Network Reachability
**Status:** SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / SOURCE-GATED / RUNTIME VERIFICATION PENDING

M6-A reuses NX-1 rather than creating a second identity system. The existing `TrustedPersonIdentity` now carries a privacy-safe `TrustedNetworkReach` aggregate. My Networks shows active networks, distinct verticals, distinct authenticated member accounts across networks the user already belongs to, identity-linked/claimed contexts, and owned/administered network counts. Migration 057 adds a counts-only RPC that never exposes or merges cross-network member identities, profile fields, relationships or graph data. Cross-network trust edges/discovery/introductions remain explicitly deferred to M6-B/M6-C. Permanent mission closure now requires a human-readable `.docx` artifact via `MISSION-DOCUMENTATION-RULE.md`.


## M6-B — Trusted Network-to-Network Linking & Governed Bridges
M6-B extends M6-A/NX-1 with an explicit neutral graph of networks. Administrators exchange private Bridge Codes, request a typed relationship, propose future discovery/introduction capability intent, and the receiving network administrator must accept or decline. Either side can revoke an accepted bridge. The bridge itself exposes no cross-network members, profiles, relationships, activity or graph data; capability intent remains inert until M6-C. All writes use the M4/M5 application command runtime. Migration: `058_m6b_network_trust_bridges.sql`.

- M6-C source implemented: privacy-safe anonymous cross-network discovery and consented trusted introductions. Runtime certification pending.

## M6-D — Network Effect Activation & Measurement
Implemented source-level. Adds privacy-safe behavioral metrics and a Network Effect Pulse in My Networks. Runtime certification requires migration 060 + local type/build + short funnel test.


## M6-E current state
Governed graph reach now supports direct and explicitly consented two-hop trusted paths. Path traversal is off by default and every edge must opt in. Anonymous discovery/consent rules remain unchanged. Runtime certification requires migration 061 plus the M6-E checklist.

## Next product program
Mission 7 is defined as Real-World Activation, Showcase & Pilot Readiness. The recommended first implementation is M7-B WOW Showcase Universe & Guided Scenario Theater because the demo will double as a product-design test harness and expose real workflow friction before pilots.

## M7-B — WOW Showcase Universe & Guided Scenario Theater
Source implemented. My Networks now includes a read-only synthetic Scenario Theater backed by a deterministic 720-person / six-network showcase universe and seven authored stories. It demonstrates direct and governed two-hop trusted reach while preserving M6 anonymous discovery and target consent. M7-B also re-ships `CrossNetworkDiscovery.tsx` to repair the observed sequential-package missing-module regression. No database migration is required. Runtime/type/build certification remains pending in the fully installed project workspace.

## M7-A — Zero-Friction Network Launch & Activation
M7-A is source implemented. My Networks now gives Owners/Admins a privacy-safe launch-readiness path: seed meaningful people/entities → bring in participants → claim/link identities → establish trusted reach when appropriate → complete a first consented outcome. Migration 062 returns aggregate counts only for networks the caller administers. Existing import/invite/claim/admin experiences are reused rather than duplicated. Validate with `npm run validate:m7a`; runtime/type/build certification is pending in the normal installed workspace. After M7-A, proceed to M7-C Guided Pilot/Admin Activation and then M7-D Pilot Feedback & Learning, using M7-B/M7-A friction as evidence.

## M7-C current state
Guided Pilot & Admin Launch Console is source implemented. My Networks now provides a privacy-safe portfolio view across networks the caller administers, including readiness, health, 30-day discovery/outcome signals and a deterministic highest-leverage intervention. Apply migration 063 and complete runtime verification before closing.

## M7-D checkpoint
Mission 7 now includes a closed product-learning loop. `PilotFeedbackLearningLoop` captures bounded contextual feedback from active members and provides Owners/Admins with aggregate 30-day learning across administered networks. Feedback remains separate from M6 discovery candidate/search data. Migration 064 is required. The next major mission should be evidence-led from real pilot friction and demonstrated repeat value.

## M7-E current state
Showcase runtime now has aggregate preflight certification and discovery zero-result diagnostics. The synthetic M7-B theater remains separate/read-only.

## M7-F — Pilot Evidence Review & Product Decision Gate
Implemented as the final planned Mission 7 closure gate. Owner/Admin users can review M7-D feedback by product moment, see an understandable evidence-derived INVEST/FIX/HOLD recommendation, and explicitly record INVEST/FIX/HOLD/STOP with rationale, next action and a bounded evidence snapshot. Recommendations never mutate roadmap, feature flags, permissions or runtime behavior automatically. Mission 7 is now closed as SHOW → GUIDE → OPERATE → LEARN → CERTIFY → DECIDE.

## LC-1 — M6/M7 Launch Control Governance Hardening
M6/M7 advanced capabilities are now fully registered in vertical-aware Founder Launch Control. They default to TEST (platform owners only), can be independently promoted per vertical/network to Pilot or Released, and My Networks fails closed when a capability is not enabled. M6-E multi-hop traversal is independently gateable from direct bridge/discovery behavior. Migration: 068.


# 2026-08-28 — Product Model Clarification: Many-to-Many Federation + Product Status
The current product model has two independent many-to-many dimensions:

1. **Person ↔ Network:** a person may belong to many independently governed Family, Alumni, Professional, Business, Organization, Franchise or Community networks.
2. **Network ↔ Umbrella/Federation:** each network may independently affiliate with zero, one or many appropriate domain umbrellas. Two Family networks may share one community umbrella; two Retail networks may share a Retail federation; an unrelated Medical network may belong to a different Medical association. Shared person membership does not imply shared umbrella membership.

M6 peer bridges remain a separate horizontal trust relationship. NF affiliation is not a peer bridge and not ownership/graph merging.

The larger system is now correctly described as a **product with a reusable platform foundation**, rather than merely a Family app. Family remains a first-class application/vertical and proving ground. Product-market fit and company traction remain future evidence questions.

The two interactive story artifacts have been rebuilt as V2 from durable project history:
- `TRUSTWEAVE-PUBLIC-PRODUCT-PROFILE.html`
- `TRUSTWEAVE-PRODUCT-EVOLUTION-JOURNEY.html`

## 2026-08-29 — NF-0A / FD-2 Federation Distribution Foundation
Started the Network Federation track with **Federation as Distribution Supernode**. A separate federation contract now encodes privacy invariants; an aggregate-only deterministic multiplier model ranks umbrella anchors; and a TEST-by-default Federation Distribution Lab is wired into My Networks through Launch Control. Real Network↔Umbrella persistence remains intentionally deferred to NF-1/NF-2.

## 2026-08-29 — NF-1 Network Passport
**SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / SOURCE-GATED / RUNTIME VERIFICATION PENDING.** Networks now have a separate persisted outward identity contract with private/federation/public visibility, admin-governed network-level metadata, declared purpose scopes, and an optional shareable `/passport/<slug>` page. The public RPC reads only explicitly public Passport rows and does not source member/profile/relationship tables. NF-1 is Launch-Controlled and TEST by default. NF-2 governed Network↔Umbrella affiliation is next.


## 2026-08-29 — NF-2 Governed Network↔Umbrella Affiliation — source implemented
The federation second dimension now has first-class umbrella anchors plus governed many-to-many affiliations. Network Owner/Admin requests require a Federation/Public Network Passport; Umbrella Owner/Admin approves or declines; approved links can be suspended/revoked. Affiliation is institutional provenance only and returns no member/profile/contact/graph data. M6 peer trust bridges remain separate. `network_affiliation` is TEST by default.

Architecture review also started CR-1: advanced My Networks capability modules now use dynamic imports so hidden/disabled advanced modules are not part of the initial client path. Roadmap adds CR-1..CR-4 for entitlement + delivery + backend activation alignment and NC-0..NC-5 for a future composable Network Type Studio capable of hundreds of customer-defined network types.

## 2026-08-29 — NF-3 Umbrella Network Runtime — source implemented
- Umbrellas can now operate on **Networks as governed participants**.
- Runtime reads approved NF-2 affiliations plus currently permitted NF-1 Passport metadata only.
- Adds aggregate affiliation/Passport readiness, vertical diversity, capability/scope mix and an approved participating-network directory.
- If a source Passport becomes Private, the approved institutional relationship remains but outward Passport fields are withheld.
- No child-network member/profile/contact/relationship graph is queried.
- `*.advanced.umbrella_runtime` is TEST by default and dynamically loaded.
- Integrated runtime validation is intentionally deferred until federation mission ZIPs are applied sequentially.

## 2026-08-29 — NF-4 Federated Directory & Discovery — source implemented
NF-4 adds authenticated Network-only discovery across approved umbrella paths. Results are derived from directory-enabled Federation/Public Network Passports and carry an explainable source-network → umbrella → target-network route. Purpose filtering operates on network-declared capabilities/scopes only; it never enrolls or exposes child-network people. Integrated runtime verification remains intentionally deferred until the federation batch is applied sequentially.

## 2026-08-29 — NF-5 Purpose-Scoped Applications — SOURCE IMPLEMENTED
NF-5 introduces explicit person-owned federation application consent. A Network Passport purpose declaration is only a prerequisite; each person separately publishes a selective outward snapshot scoped to one source network, one approved umbrella and one purpose. Profiles are withdrawable and contain no inherited private-network contacts/relationships. Integrated runtime verification is intentionally deferred with the current NF batch strategy.


## 2026-08-29 — NF-6 Trusted Request Routing — source implemented
NF-6 is source-implemented after NF-5. Users can create a purpose-scoped request inside an eligible source Network → approved Umbrella → Purpose context. Routing persists deterministic candidate evidence derived only from active NF-5 opt-in snapshots whose affiliation, Passport and declared purpose remain valid. Requesters can refresh, shortlist or dismiss routes and close/cancel requests. NF-6 does not notify a target, reveal private contacts or create an introduction. Launch Control key: `*.advanced.trusted_request_routing`, federation bundle, TEST by default. Integrated runtime validation remains intentionally deferred until the sequential federation ZIP verification pass.

Documentation strategy also now includes `DOCUMENTATION-CONTROLLED-REVEAL-ARCHITECTURE.md` and a planned standalone `trustweave-docs` repository with role-specific User, Community Head, Agent/Operator, Partner, Developer, Architecture and Founder layers.


### NF-7 checkpoint
Governed federated introductions are source-implemented. Only shortlisted NF-6 routes can request contact; the target explicitly accepts/declines and requester contact remains withheld until acceptance. Dedicated architecture/privacy gate and i18n audit pass. Runtime and full NF-1→NF-8 compile/import validation remain intentionally deferred to NF-8 closure.

### NF-8 / federation batch closure checkpoint
NF-8 Outcome + Trust Receipt is source-implemented. Accepted NF-7 introductions receive a durable provenance snapshot and both participants can independently record private outcome evidence. Requesters may optionally close the originating request when recording an outcome. Outcome evidence is not public reputation and does not automatically alter NF-6 routing.

NF-1→NF-8 source hardening is complete: all dedicated mission gates pass, relative imports across federation integration files resolve, selected NF TypeScript/TSX files syntax-transpile, and i18n AST audit reports zero visible literals. Full project TypeScript remains blocked in this extracted workspace by missing third-party type-definition libraries. Integrated runtime/database verification remains intentionally pending until the user applies the releases sequentially.

## NX-8 My Networks Guided Control Center — source implemented
The NX-7 information architecture has been refined into a progressive-disclosure control center. The default remains the user's actual networks. Advanced areas use plain-language outcome navigation and only one selected capability is rendered at a time. Federation and Request/Outcome concepts are presented as guided step sequences, while Launch & Learn is clearly identified as administrator-oriented. Launch Control remains authoritative per network type. Runtime UX review is pending.


## NX-9 My Networks contextual guidance refinement — source checkpoint

NX-8's guided control center is retained. NX-9 adds on-demand contextual explainers for the active area/tool, tailored privacy/usage guidance, recommended next moves and additional visual focus polish. Advanced capabilities remain independently Launch-Controlled and lazy-loaded; the help layer changes comprehension only, not authorization or rollout semantics. Runtime UX review is pending.


# 2026-08-29 — MPF-A0 Community / Association Vertical — SOURCE COMPLETE / RUNTIME GATE OPEN

A seventh active vertical, **Community / Association**, is now composed from the existing Generic Network OS productized runtime. Its primary membership unit can be a family/household with one representative while people, committees and locations remain first-class entities. V1 includes association creation, annual membership year/status, household/representative semantics, directory/explorer, events + RSVP, memories/media capability, announcements, committees/circles, contributions, Playground and Launch Control.

The implementation is generic; MPF East is only the first intended real pilot/configuration. Formal election-grade voting is deliberately not claimed as complete and remains a later governed enhancement. Migration: `078_mpfa0_community_association_vertical.sql`. Source gate: `npm run validate:mpfa0`.

Next evidence gate: create MPF East in staging, onboard 5–10 real families, verify the family-representative registration flow and community-life loops, then let real usage drive MPF-A1 enhancements.


## MPF-A1 — Family-Grade Association Experience

Community / Association is now a Family-grade active vertical with a dedicated signature Home, full person profiles, household relationships, Me & My Family, upcoming birthdays/events, community history, scoped household co-admins, and a distinct Mahesh-inspired Light/Dark/Aurora visual system. Source validation passes; real-repository build/runtime certification remains required.

## FCA-0 — Family Community / Cultural Association — SOURCE COMPLETE, RUNTIME VERIFY
A new `family-association` vertical has been added without changing generic Association. It composes Family-grade people/profile/hierarchy with annual family membership, temporal history, controlled governance roles, community finance, Coming Up/history, member discovery, family co-admins, engagement and safe network lifecycle. MPF East is the first proving configuration; code remains generic. `validate:fca0` passes 27 checks. Runtime database/build/UI verification remains required before the 10-family pilot.

## HS-0 Housing Society Vertical Foundation — source checkpoint
`housing-society` is now source-implemented as a first-class productized TrustWeave vertical. Unit/Flat is the primary operating object; Building/Wing/Floor are hierarchy dimensions; Household and Person remain first-class linked identities. The resident composition uses familiar society terminology and hides Intelligence/advanced platform machinery. A synthetic 24-unit playground, rerun-safe migration 082, source gate, guide entries and civic theme are included. Complaints, maintenance, billing, facilities, governance, security and compliance remain future missions. Status: **SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY**.

## HS-1 Property, Household & Resident Core — source checkpoint
**SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY.** Housing Society now has temporal owner/co-owner/tenant/occupant history, My Flat, verified-email society invitation claiming, vehicles/parking, and mapped Excel/CSV onboarding designed for the 20–50 unit pilot gate. Official property facts and parking allocations remain admin governed; resident vehicle writes are restricted to current occupied flats. Migration 083 is additive/rerunnable and preserves HS-0/FCA contracts. Runtime certification remains pending on staging Supabase.

## HS-2 Daily Society Operations — source checkpoint
**SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY.** The two HS-0 regression defects are fixed: optional unknown feature probes fail closed instead of crashing, and Housing Society is exhaustive in the shared intelligence type/copy contracts. HS-2 adds society-scoped notices, complaint/SLA/comments/evidence workflow, vendor/contracts, amenities/bookings and Coming Up, while reusing the shared event/RSVP/memory/timeline engine. Migration 084 is additive/rerunnable. HS-3 billing remains intentionally excluded.

## 2026-09-07 — HS-3 Maintenance, Dues & Finance
HS-3 is source implemented. Housing Society now has typed finance capabilities, flat-level maintenance bills, charge heads, billing cycles, immutable bill lines, adjustments/waivers, manual payments + receipts, arrears, funds and budget-vs-actual visibility. The HS-2 `CapabilityId` build regression is fixed centrally. Runtime staging verification of migration 085 and one reconciled 20–50-unit billing cycle remains required.

## HS-4 — Governance, Meetings & Decisions — SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY
Delivered source: historical committee terms and office-bearer assignments, AGM/SGM/committee meetings, ordered agenda, published minutes, action register, resolutions, controlled one-member-one-vote approval/advisory decisions and governance document references. Election-grade secret voting remains deliberately deferred. Runtime closure requires migration 086 plus one real meeting-to-resolution lifecycle. **Next: HS-5 Security, Compliance & Asset Operations.**

## HS-5 — Security, Compliance & Asset Operations — SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY
Delivered source: scoped security/facility/compliance operator grants; resident flat-scoped visitor pre-approval; check-in/out; domestic staff + flat permissions; move-in/out; renovation/NOC approval; society asset/warranty/service history; compliance calendar; emergency contacts. Runtime closure requires migration 087 plus one real security/approval/asset/compliance smoke.


## HS-6 — Founder Society Pilot & Commercialization — SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY
The Housing Society source roadmap is complete through commercialization readiness. HS-6 adds pilot phases A/B/C/D, evidence-based readiness, unit activation/weekly usage/notice readership/complaint-resolution metrics, operator-value checkpoints, pricing experiments, evidence export, reusable pilot import assets and a second-society repeatability gate. This is not runtime-certified: migrations 082–088 and the real founder pilot still require user verification. Deferred integrations remain backlog until evidence justifies them.

## 2026-09-07 — Cross-vertical onboarding & lifecycle parity closure
- Family, Alumni, Housing Society, Family Association, Association, Organization, Business Trust, Franchise and Professional now expose a consistent creation decision point: Build together, Excel/CSV import, or Start small.
- Alumni and all productized vertical shells now expose the shared Language switcher and Public / Member / Admin privacy preview controls already proven in Family.
- Public/Member preview suppresses admin navigation in Alumni/productized shells until Admin preview is restored.
- Network Owners can permanently delete creator-owned networks from My Networks using exact-name confirmation plus a second destructive confirmation. Migration 089 provides a vertical-neutral owner-authorized delete RPC; account identity and other networks remain intact.
- Status: SOURCE VERIFIED. Runtime verification still required before broad onboarding, especially for unverified HS-4 through HS-6 migrations and destructive-delete behavior in staging.

## 2026-09-08 — XP-0 Network Lifecycle Safety — SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME VERIFY
Cross-vertical lifecycle now has explicit Leave, reversible Archive, Restore, and verified Permanent Purge semantics. Archive snapshots membership states and preserves all domain/media data. Hard purge explicitly removes network-prefixed Supabase Storage, deletes the network, then performs a metadata-driven scan of every public FK referencing `networks(id)` plus Storage residue; any residue aborts the transaction. A minimal platform-owned zero-residue purge receipt is intentionally retained. Family no longer silently archives through Leave. Runtime staging verification of migration 090 is pending.

## XP-1 — Guided Workbook Onboarding Platform — SOURCE COMPLETE

A shared versioned Import Schema Registry now covers all nine released verticals. Registry-driven XLSX generation supplies README, Column Guide, sample rows, required/optional/type/enum/reference guidance, privacy notes and schema version. A shared parser classifies valid/warning/rejected rows and blocks missing sheets/columns, invalid values, duplicate/ambiguous stable IDs and unresolved references before commit. Alumni and Housing Society preserve their domain-specific import semantics; other productized verticals use stable-ID-aware entity/relationship adapters; Family retains its mature specialized kinship workbook flow. Source/type/parse gates are complete; browser/staging import verification remains pending.


## 2026-09-08 — XP-1 workbook sheet-name runtime hotfix
The guided XLSX generator now sanitizes Excel-forbidden worksheet characters (`: \ / ? * [ ]`), enforces the 31-character worksheet-name limit, and deterministically resolves collisions after sanitization/truncation. The parser resolves the same generated names while retaining compatibility with valid legacy/manual sheet names. This fixes the Housing Society template download crash caused by `Occupancy / Ownership / Tenancy`. XP-1 source gate strengthened to 31/31 checks; full inherited XP-1 → XP-0 → platform → HS/FCA chain passes. Browser download/re-upload smoke remains recommended.


## XP-1 runtime closure addendum
Runtime testing found and corrected two source-gate blind spots: cross-vertical Choose-how-to-start previously appended step 2 below the fold, and XP-0 used unsupported direct SQL deletion from `storage.objects`. Productized/Alumni onboarding is now a real two-step flow. Permanent deletion now uses an authenticated server route plus Supabase Storage API/service-role purge before relational finalization. Migration 091 must be applied and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` configured before hard-delete runtime certification. Source/regression gates pass; staging/browser verification remains pending.


## XP-2 update — i18n Closure
Released production surfaces now consume shared i18n catalog tokens for the XP audit backlog. The AST visible-literal audit is zero; English/Hindi/Marathi catalog shape is complete. Browser/native-language QA remains pending before runtime certification.


## XP-3 update — Quick Start & Activation
Shared role-aware Quick Start is configured across all released verticals, persisted per user/network, dismissible/resumable, progress-aware and linked to real actions. Family retains its mature Quick Family Start. Migration 092 requires staging verification.

## XP-4 Shared Admin Center
Source-complete: shared role-aware admin registry/shell across all nine released verticals; Productized and Alumni integrated, Family mature admin preserved. Runtime role/browser verification pending.

## XP-5 Backup / Export / Recovery
Source-complete: versioned logical JSON backup + XLSX export + Storage media manifest across shared Admin surfaces. Security credentials excluded; full automatic restore intentionally not claimed. Migration 093/staging restore verification pending.

## XP-6 Invitation / Claiming / Correction Parity
Source-complete: shared invite lifecycle (email attempt + private-link fallback, resend, revoke, expiration, accept), membership activation, duplicate identity-claim guard and correction-review audit. Family/Alumni mature identity semantics preserved. Migration 094/runtime mail matrix pending.

## XP-7 — Guide, What's New & Readiness Closure
**SOURCE CLOSED / RUNTIME CERTIFICATION PENDING.** A role-aware/vertical-aware contextual guide now covers all nine released verticals without replacing Family's mature GuidePortal. Productized verticals and Alumni use persisted, vertical-filtered What's New announcements and a shared Network Health panel based only on known signals. The final executable regression matrix covers 9 verticals × 6 actor states × 4 lifecycle states = 216 cells. The final cumulative baseline also includes the missing `NetworkParticipationAdmin` module, restores the mature participation contract exports alongside XP-6 additions, fixes explicit API failure narrowing, and corrects XP-2 cases where translated display labels had leaked into machine role/status comparisons. No migration 095 is required; the sequence remains 090 → 094. Full browser/staging/Next-build certification remains pending.

---
## 2026-09-08 — QA-first strategic reset
Feature expansion is paused after XP-7 runtime closure. The primary product mission is now **Runtime Certification & Product Hardening**. A dedicated `qa/` quality-engineering layer has been added with Playwright scaffolding, owner/admin/member exploratory crawlers, runtime console/network capture, bug reporting, cross-vertical catalog, safety guards, migration static audit, and a full generic + vertical-specific test catalog. Existing source gates remain useful but are explicitly not considered runtime certification.

## QA Mega Mission state — 2026-09-08

Feature development is paused. The repository now includes the automated QA Mega Mission harness (unit/contracts, DB replay/integrity/RPC, RLS/storage/invitation security, API integration, 9-vertical×3-role Playwright, golden/deep flows, guided workbook roundtrip, expert crawler, axe/mobile/cross-browser, lifecycle/import/purge, volume/resilience, and evidence-backed reporting). The next product activity is runtime execution/remediation, not new feature development. Use `qa/LOCAL-RUNTIME-CERTIFICATION-GUIDE.md` and run `npm run qa:certify` on dedicated staging.
