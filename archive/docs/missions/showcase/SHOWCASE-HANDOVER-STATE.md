# TrustWeave Showcase Mission — Consolidated Handover State

This ZIP is the consolidated source baseline prepared for the Showcase UX mission.

## Certified QA state

- Phase 2 — Representative Capability Certification: `PHASE2_CERTIFIED`
- Phase 4A — Runtime Robustness & Recovery: `PHASE4A_CERTIFIED`
- Phase 4B — Data Integrity / Import / Export / Recovery: `PHASE4B_CERTIFIED`
- Phase 4C — Governance / Permissions / Destructive-Action Safety: `PHASE4C_CERTIFIED`
- Phase 4D — Vertical-Specific Workflow & Business-Rule Certification: `PHASE4D_CERTIFIED`

## Paused / not certified

- Phase 3 broad parity/security was functionally green but never formally certified because of the unresolved Storage/RLS upload blocker.
- Phase 5A Security Contract & RPC Closure is paused at Batch-1 contract review. The latest audit reported `REMEDIATION_REQUIRED`; do not treat Phase 5A as certified.
- Phase 5B and Phase 5C tooling exists but has not been certified.
- Do not resume Phase 5A/5B/5C during the Showcase UX mission unless explicitly requested.

## Source-history normalization in this handover

- The proven Phase-3 SECURITY DEFINER NULL-bypass hardening migration is stored as `098_phase3_security_definer_null_authorization_hardening.sql` to avoid collision with the existing `095_xp7_admin_status_ambiguity_hotfix.sql`.
- Experimental Phase-3 Storage migrations `096` and `097` are intentionally excluded from this source baseline.
- The live Supabase staging project may still contain experimental effects from those previously applied migrations (including the historical 1 MB bucket-cap experiment). Treat that as environment drift to reconcile later, not as accepted source baseline behavior.

## Showcase mission constraint

Feature expansion and strict security remediation are paused. Priority is first-impression UX, Playground, and polished creation/usage of:

1. Family
2. Family Community / Cultural Association
3. Residential Community / Housing Society

Preserve existing QA coverage and security/business-rule assertions while transforming UX/UI.

## Showcase progress — S0/S1/S2

- S0 Showcase Control Plane implemented: founder-controlled Create / Playground / Featured / curated palette per vertical.
- S1 deterministic MPF Pune East + Emerald Heights showcase universe strengthened. JSON packs are source/reference only and require no manual database upload.
- S2 First Impression Foundation implemented: TrustWeave-wide sign-in, focused Family / Community / Residential / Explore entry, Launch-Control-filtered Playground gallery, and a runtime guard preventing hidden Playground types from opening through alternate routes such as “Back to network selection”.
- Next planned mission: S3 Navigation & Progressive Disclosure.

## S3 — Navigation, Progressive Disclosure, Appearance & High-Visibility i18n
Status: IMPLEMENTED / TARGETED SOURCE VALIDATION PASS

Completed:
- reduced primary navigation for Family Community and Residential
- advanced capabilities moved to role-aware More areas instead of removed
- mobile More prevents destinations from becoming unreachable
- five user Appearance themes: Light / Warm / Modern / Aurora / Dark
- Light keeps editorial/vintage character; non-Light themes use cleaner typography
- Dark contrast repaired for Family guide/ready/sidebar surfaces reported in showcase review
- founder Brand palette remains a separate five-choice control in Launch Control
- key login/setup/menu/Playground/My Networks copy expanded into Hindi and Marathi locale files
- localized flagship navigation labels added to vertical compositions

No database migration added for S3.

Validation:
- Showcase S3 12/12 PASS
- Showcase S2 9/9 PASS
- FCA0 27/27 PASS
- HS0–HS5 PASS
- changed-file TypeScript syntax transpile PASS

Known inherited validation limitations:
- repository-wide TypeScript check is blocked by pre-existing syntax errors in qa/e2e/19-phase4b-data-integrity-recovery.spec.ts
- historical NX6 source gate has three pre-existing source-string assertions already failing on the S2 baseline

## Showcase Stabilization + Certification — 2026-09-12

Status: IMPLEMENTED / SOURCE-CERTIFIED.

This mission hardens the three showcase journeys without removing or changing business capabilities.

### Stabilized contracts
- Auth/sign-in hydration shows visible loading feedback.
- My Networks opening/switching shows visible loading feedback and actionable errors.
- Existing memberships remain independent of Launch Control showcase visibility.
- Playground discovery remains filtered by Launch Control.
- Authenticated Playground Back returns to My Networks.
- Setup/create asynchronous work exposes a loader.
- Mobile "Choose how to start" remains reachable with safe-area padding.
- Sign-in, account-menu and mobile More surfaces support dismiss/back behavior including Escape where applicable.
- Five Appearance themes remain available.
- MPF and Residential flagship homes retain stable certification anchors.
- Launch Control owner-registry copy is localized through EN/HI/MR dictionaries.

### Automated certification assets
- `scripts/showcase-stabilization-certification-gate.mjs`
- `qa/e2e/24-showcase-stabilization-certification.spec.ts`
- `npm run validate:showcase-stabilization`
- `npm run qa:showcase`
- `npm run qa:showcase:headed`

Source/regression gates are green. Browser E2E is intentionally left for the configured QA environment and has not been claimed as executed in this extracted baseline.

### No database migration
No Supabase migration is required for this mission. Existing 099–102 remain the current showcase/control-plane migrations.

### Next mission
**Engagement, Notifications & Media Foundation**.

Planned scope is captured in `NEXT-MISSION-ENGAGEMENT-NOTIFICATIONS-MEDIA.md` and includes persisted in-app notifications + deep links, web/PWA push delivery, role/mention routing, Residential complaint assignment + photos, shared compressed-media pipeline, archive/quota/cleanup controls, followed by MPF funds/events and election/voting engagement flows.
