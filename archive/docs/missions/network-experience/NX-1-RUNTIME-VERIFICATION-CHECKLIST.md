# NX-1 — Runtime Verification Checklist

Use this checklist at the NX-1 milestone verification window, not after every small follow-up change.

## My Networks
- Sign in to an account with 2+ memberships.
- Open `My Networks` from the Family top bar.
- Confirm every membership shows the correct vertical icon/type, name and role.
- Confirm Organization, Business Trust and Franchise are **not** shown as Family.
- Switch between at least Family + one non-Family network and confirm the correct vertical app opens.

## Privacy / identity UX
- Confirm My Networks explains that profiles remain separate by network.
- Confirm no member list/profile data from one network appears on another network card.
- Confirm only the signed-in user's own memberships are shown.

## Playground
- From My Networks, open sample Family, Alumni, Organization, Business Trust and Franchise.
- Confirm each sample opens the correct vertical and remains read-only/demo-scoped.

## Regression
- Existing Family tree/home/profile flows still work.
- Existing Alumni claiming and runtime still work.
- Existing productized network join/create/runtime still work.
- Existing active-network switching still persists correctly.

## Build
- Run `npm ci` if dependencies are not installed.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run existing G1.3 / G2 / G8.5-C source gates.

## UX hardening checks from first milestone review
- Open `Add or join network`: the onboarding content should use the available width; `Safe Playgrounds` and `Network OS products` must span the card instead of being trapped in one narrow grid column.
- From `My Networks`, open a real network, then press the browser Back button: it should return to `My Networks`.
- From `My Networks`, open a Playground, then press browser Back: it should return to `My Networks`.
- In Organization / Business Trust / Franchise Home, verify `Network health` shows one readable percentage inside the ring with its label outside the ring; no overlapping text.
- While signed in, confirm `Sign out` is available from My Networks, Family, Alumni and productized vertical shells (including a signed-in Playground view).
- Open a Family member profile on desktop/tablet: it should appear as an elevated panel with outer margin and dimmed backdrop, not as a full-height edge-to-edge sheet.
- On mobile, confirm the Family profile still behaves as a bottom sheet and remains scrollable.
