# Mission 7 — Real-World Activation, Showcase & Pilot Readiness

## Why Mission 7 exists
Network OS now has enough platform and trust machinery. The next existential risk is not engineering capability; it is that evaluators and early users may never naturally discover the combination of features that makes the product exceptional.

Mission 7 therefore treats **demo, activation and pilot learning as product capabilities**.

## Desired reaction
A strong showcase should move a user through this emotional sequence:
1. “Okay, family/alumni/community network — I understand.”
2. “Wait, these networks can connect without merging/private-data leakage?”
3. “It can tell me relevant help exists without exposing the person?”
4. “I can request a trusted introduction and the other person controls consent?”
5. “This solves something I actually struggle with.”
6. “Why has nobody given me this before?”

## M7-A — Zero-Friction Network Launch & Activation — MEDIUM
Turn existing onboarding/import/invite/claim/admin capabilities into a guided path from empty network to useful network.

Activation journey:
`Create → seed/import → recruit 3–5 contributors → invite → claim identities → complete useful context → bridge when appropriate → first outcome`.

Focus:
- purpose-driven setup;
- best-next-step guidance;
- contributor recruitment;
- claim completion;
- minimal useful data before advanced features;
- reuse existing launch/import/invite machinery instead of rebuilding it.

## M7-B — WOW Showcase Universe & Guided Scenario Theater — MEDIUM-HIGH — RECOMMENDED FIRST
Create a carefully designed synthetic mini-world, not random sample data.

### Showcase universe
Target roughly 600–900 deliberately interconnected synthetic identities/entities across:
- Family;
- Alumni;
- Professional/Expertise;
- Founder/Business;
- Franchise;
- Community.

A subset of people deliberately overlap across networks so M6-A identity context, M6-B bridges, M6-C introductions, M6-D measurement and M6-E two-hop paths all become visible.

### Scenario Theater
Add an **Experience the Network Effect** playground with 5–7 guided scenarios such as:
- trusted pediatric specialist help in Pune;
- AI/PIM architecture expert;
- senior frontend architect hiring/referral;
- alumni mentorship/career guidance;
- relocation/local trusted help;
- startup CA/legal/commercial-property expertise;
- family/community skill discovery.

Each scenario should demonstrate:
`Need → direct network insufficient → trusted path → anonymous opportunity → introduction request → consent → useful connection → pulse movement`.

Some scenarios should resolve directly, some via one bridge, and selected WOW scenarios via an M6-E governed two-hop path.

The demo is also a **product-design test harness**: if a scenario feels cumbersome, fix the real UX rather than hiding the friction with narration.

## M7-C — Guided Pilot & Admin Launch Console — MEDIUM
Give organizers a concrete launch state instead of a feature catalog.

Example:
- network created ✓
- 18 people seeded ✓
- 6 identities claimed ✓
- contributor coverage low △
- no trusted bridge ○
- no successful introduction ○

Then provide one deterministic best next action.

## M7-D — Pilot Feedback & Product Learning Loop — MEDIUM
Measure where real pilots activate or stall.

Core milestones:
- network created;
- first member seeded;
- first contributor joined;
- first claim;
- 10 claimed identities;
- first bridge;
- first discovery;
- first introduction;
- first accepted introduction.

Capture lightweight qualitative feedback only at meaningful points:
- Was this useful?
- What were you trying to accomplish?
- What stopped you?
- Would you use this with another network?

## Recommended order
`M7-B WOW Showcase → M7-A launch optimization → M7-C real pilot → M7-D learn from usage`.

Reason: building the strongest possible demo first will reveal whether the product itself is understandable and which workflow friction must be fixed before real pilot activation.

## Guardrails
- showcase data must be synthetic and clearly marked;
- do not fake privacy bypasses to make demos easier;
- every scenario must exercise the real product path;
- quality of 5–7 end-to-end stories matters more than thousands of random records;
- do not create new architecture merely for presentation effects;
- M7 learning should determine what gets built after M7.

## M7-B implementation update — WOW Showcase Universe V1
M7-B is now source implemented with a deterministic **720-person synthetic universe**, six network types and seven guided stories. The implementation deliberately uses authored scenarios rather than random rows and includes both one-hop and M6-E governed two-hop examples. `NetworkEffectShowcase` is embedded in My Networks as a read-only Scenario Theater. The theater preserves anonymous discovery and target consent rather than bypassing privacy for presentation convenience.

The seven V1 stories are: pediatric specialist help, AI/PIM architecture expertise, senior frontend referral, alumni mentorship, Pune relocation guidance, startup CA/finance expertise, and Indore franchise/property guidance.

M7-B should now be used as a product-design test harness before M7-A: any confusing stage in these stories is evidence that the real activation workflow needs simplification.

## M7-A implementation update — Zero-Friction Launch V1
M7-A is now source implemented. My Networks includes a Launch Activation guide for networks the signed-in person owns/administers. It measures five progressive signals — seeded people/entities, active participants, claimed identities, accepted bridges and accepted introductions — and gives one deterministic best next action. Migration 062 provides counts-only admin-scoped snapshots. Existing import, invite, claim and network admin screens remain authoritative; M7-A orchestrates them instead of replacing them.

## M7-C implementation update — Guided Pilot & Admin Launch Console V1
M7-C is now source implemented as a portfolio operating layer above M7-A. My Networks aggregates every network the signed-in user owns/administers into Starting, Progressing, Needs attention or Value proven states. It surfaces seeded entities, active participants, claimed identities, accepted bridges and 30-day discovery/introduction activity, then deterministically identifies the highest-leverage missing constraint. Migration 063 is counts/timestamps only and preserves all M6 privacy boundaries. M7-A remains the per-network action guide; M7-C only prioritizes where an organizer should intervene.

## M7-D — Pilot Feedback & Product Learning Loop — SOURCE IMPLEMENTED
M7-D closes the Mission 7 learning loop with lightweight contextual feedback rather than long surveys. Members can record whether a meaningful step helped, partly helped or blocked them, choose a bounded friction category, and optionally add a short non-sensitive note. Owners/Admins see aggregate helpful/blocked rates, top friction, per-network learning and recent de-identified notes. M7-D deliberately does not join feedback to M6 search text, candidate identities or contact data. Migration: `064_m7d_pilot_feedback_product_learning.sql`.

### Mission 7 completion model
`M7-B SHOW → M7-A GUIDE → M7-C OPERATE → M7-D LEARN`.
Future missions should now be selected from repeated pilot friction, successful outcomes and real adoption evidence rather than capability accumulation alone.

## M7-F closure — Pilot Evidence Review & Product Decision Gate
Mission 7 is complete with M7-F. The final operating loop is `SHOW → GUIDE → OPERATE → LEARN → CERTIFY → DECIDE`. Future trusted-network work should be opened because M7-F evidence supports INVEST/FIX or because an explicit business goal overrides the current evidence—not because the capability backlog is interesting.
